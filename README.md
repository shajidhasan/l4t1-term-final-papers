# CUET ME L4T1 - Term Final Papers Archive

**It's Live Here:** [https://l4t1.sh4jid.me](https://l4t1.sh4jid.me)

---

## About

As a mechanical engineering student, preparing for term finals often meant digging through scattered question papers from previous batches. I needed a better way to browse, search, and study from past exam questions efficiently. This project solves that problem by creating a centralized, searchable archive of previous term final papers.

Built by [sh4jid](https://sh4jid.me) for CUET ME students and anyone who might find it useful.

## Features

- Full-text search across questions and solutions with course filtering
- Browse questions by engineering topics and course codes
- Comprehensive solutions with KaTeX-rendered mathematical formulas
- Mark questions as studied with persistent state
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use
- Built with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Client-side search powered by MiniSearch

## Courses Included

| Course Code | Course Title | Credits | Instructors |

## Fork for Your Own Course

Want to create a similar archive for your own course or university? Here's how:

### 1. Fork the Repository
Click the "Fork" button on GitHub to create your own copy.

### 2. Update Course Information
- Edit [`src/lib/courses.ts`](src/lib/courses.ts) with your course details
- Update the course codes, titles, and instructor information

### 3. Prepare Your Data
You'll need to convert your question papers into the required JSON format. Each course should have a JSON file in [`src/lib/data/`](src/lib/data/) with this structure:

```json
[
  {
    "batch": "19",
    "paper": {
      "sections": [
        {
          "name": "A",
          "sets": [
            {
              "number": 1,
              "questions": [
                {
                  "text": "Your question text here",
                  "marks": 10,
                  "id": "COURSE-BATCH-SET-QUESTION",
                  "topic": "Topic Name",
                  "solution": "Detailed solution in markdown format"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### 4. Use an LLM for Data Conversion
**Important:** You'll need to use a Large Language Model (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to parse your existing question papers and convert them into the required JSON format. The LLM can help you:

- Extract questions from PDF or image files
- Structure the data according to the schema
- Generate the unique IDs for each question
- Format solutions in markdown with proper mathematical notation

### 5. Update Imports
- Add your new course data files to [`src/lib/papers.ts`](src/lib/papers.ts)
- Update the imports and exports accordingly

### 6. Customize Branding
- Update the title and metadata in [`src/routes/+page.svelte`](src/routes/+page.svelte)
- Modify the footer and any university-specific information
- Update the favicon and other static assets in the [`static/`](static/) directory

### 7. Deploy
Deploy your customized version to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
