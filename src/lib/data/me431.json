The lower of the two calculated power ratings determines the gearset's true capacity.\n\n### 1. Geometric Properties and Velocity\n\nFirst, let's find the basic dimensions and speed of the gear set.\n\n*   **Pinion Pitch Diameter ($d_p$):**\n    $d_p = \\frac{\\text{Number of Pinion Teeth } (N_p)}{\\text{Diametral Pitch } (P_d)} = \\frac{20}{10} = 2.0 \\text{ in}$\n*   **Pitch-Line Velocity ($V$):**\n    This is the linear speed of the gear teeth at the pitch diameter.\n    $$\n    V = \\frac{\\pi d_p n_p}{12} = \\frac{\\pi (2.0 \\text{ in})(1200 \\text{ rev/min})}{12 \\text{ in/ft}} = 628 \\text{ ft/min}\n    $$\n\n### 2. Bending Strength (Tooth Fatigue)\n\nThis calculation determines the power the gears can transmit without breaking a tooth. The allowable power for bending ($H_{bending}$) is found using the AGMA formula.\n\n*   **Key Factors:**\n    *   **Allowable Bending Stress ($S_{at}$):** Based on material (300 BHN steel), life ($3 \\times 10^6$ cycles), and reliability (99%). From standard tables, a reasonable value is $S_{at} \\approx 37,800$ psi.\n    *   **Geometry Factor ($J$):** Accounts for tooth shape. For this gearset, $J \\approx 0.21$.\n    *   **Dynamic Factor ($K_v$):** Accounts for inaccuracies in the gear teeth. For an accuracy number of 5 at this speed, $K_v \\approx 1.4$.\n    *   **Overload Factor ($K_o$):** For \"general industrial use,\" we expect moderate shock. A typical value is $K_o = 1.5$.\n    *   **Mounting Factor ($K_m$):** Accounts for shaft and bearing alignment. For a standard industrial mount, $K_m \\approx 1.6$.\n\n*   **Allowable Tangential Load ($W_t$):**\n    This is the maximum force the teeth can handle.\n    $$\n    W_t = \\frac{S_{at} F J}{P_d} \\frac{1}{K_o K_v K_m}\n    $$\n    $$\n    W_t = \\frac{(37,800 \\text{ psi})(0.71 \\text{ in})(0.21)}{10 \\text{ teeth/in}} \\frac{1}{(1.5)(1.4)(1.6)} = 167.8 \\text{ lb}\n    $$\n\n*   **Allowable Power (Bending):**\n    $$\n    H_{bending} = \\frac{W_t V}{33,000} = \\frac{(167.8 \\text{ lb})(628 \\text{ ft/min})}{33,000} = 3.2 \\text{ hp}\n    $$\n\n### 3. Wear Strength (Pitting Resistance)\n\nThis calculation determines the power the gears can transmit without the tooth surfaces failing due to pitting.\n\n*   **Key Factors:**\n    *   **Allowable Contact Stress ($S_{ac}$):** Based on material, life, and reliability. For 300 BHN steel, $S_{ac} \\approx 126,500$ psi.\n    *   **Elastic Coefficient ($C_p$):** For steel on steel gears, $C_p = 2300 \\sqrt{\\text{psi}}$.\n    *   **Geometry Factor ($I$):** Accounts for tooth curvature. For this gearset, $I \\approx 0.08$.\n    *   The factors $K_o$, $K_v$, and $K_m$ are the same as used for bending.\n\n*   **Allowable Tangential Load ($W_{t,wear}$):**\n    $$\n    W_{t,wear} = \\frac{F I d_p}{K_o K_v K_m} \\left( \\frac{S_{ac}}{C_p} \\right)^2\n    $$\n    $$\n    W_{t,wear} = \\frac{(0.71)(0.08)(2.0)}{(1.5)(1.4)(1.6)} \\left( \\frac{126,500}{2300} \\right)^2 = 102.2 \\text{ lb}\n    $$\n\n*   **Allowable Power (Wear):**\n    $$\n    H_{wear} = \\frac{W_{t,wear} V}{33,000} = \\frac{(102.2 \\text{ lb})(628 \\text{ ft/min})}{33,000} = 1.95 \\text{ hp}\n    $$\n\n### 4. Opinion on the Catalog Rating\n\n*   **Calculated Rating:** The gearset's performance is limited by its wear strength. Our calculation shows an allowable power of **1.95 hp**.\n*   **Catalog Rating:** The catalog states a rating of **5.2 hp**.\n\nThe calculated rating (1.95 hp) is significantly lower than the catalog rating (5.2 hp). This discrepancy is common and can be explained by the assumptions made.\n\nOur calculation used application factors ($K_o = 1.5, K_m = 1.6$) suitable for \"general industrial use.\" Catalog ratings, however, are often based on ideal conditions where these factors are equal to 1.0 (i.e., no shock loads and perfect, rigid mounting).\n\nLet's recalculate the wear rating assuming these ideal catalog conditions ($K_o = 1.0, K_m = 1.0$):\n$$\nH_{wear, ideal} = 1.95 \\text{ hp} \\times (1.5) \\times (1.6) = 4.68 \\text{ hp}\n$$\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUnder idealized laboratory conditions (uniform power, no shock, and perfect mounting), the gearset is rated for about **4.7 hp**. This is very close to the catalog's **5.2 hp** rating. The small remaining difference can be attributed to the manufacturer using slightly different material data or geometry factors.\n\nTherefore, the catalog rating of 5.2 hp is **plausible but optimistic**. It represents a base rating under perfect conditions. For any real-world \"general industrial use,\" this rating must be significantly reduced by applying appropriate overload and mounting factors, bringing the realistic power capacity down to around **2.0 hp**."

                                    "solution": "Here is the step-by-step solution to the band brake problem.\n\n### Given Data:\n*   Drum Diameter, $D = 16$ in\n*   Drum Radius, $r = D/2 = 8$ in\n*   Band Width, $w = 3$ in\n*   Drum Speed, $n = 200$ rev/min (counterclockwise)\n*   Coefficient of Friction, $\\mu = 0.20$\n*   Maximum Pressure, $p_{max} = 70$ psi\n*   Lever Dimensions: $a = 3$ in, $L = 10$ in\n\n***\n\n### Step 1: Find the Band Tensions ($F_1$ and $F_2$)\n\nFirst, we identify the tight side ($F_1$) and slack side ($F_2$) of the band. Since the drum rotates counterclockwise, the friction will pull the band tighter on the side that is attached to the lever arm. This becomes the tight side, $F_1$. The side attached to the main pivot is the slack side, $F_2$.\n\nThe maximum tension ($F_1$) is determined by the maximum allowable pressure on the band.\n\n$$\nF_1 = p_{max} \\cdot w \\cdot r\n$$\n\n$$\nF_1 = (70 \\text{ psi}) \\cdot (3 \\text{ in}) \\cdot (8 \\text{ in}) = 1680 \\text{ lb}\n$$\n\nNext, we relate the tight and slack side tensions using the band brake equation.\n\n$$\n\\frac{F_1}{F_2} = e^{\\mu \\theta}\n$$\n\nSince the wrap angle ($\\theta$) is not given, we will assume a standard wrap of **270\u00b0**, which is a common value for this type of brake. We must convert this angle to radians.\n\n*   $\\theta = 270^\\circ = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ radians $\\approx 4.712$ rad\n\nNow, we can find the slack side tension, $F_2$.\n\n$$\nF_2 = \\frac{F_1}{e^{\\mu \\theta}} = \\frac{1680}{e^{(0.20)(4.712)}} = \\frac{1680}{e^{0.9424}} = \\frac{1680}{2.566} \\approx 654.7 \\text{ lb}\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Find the Maximum Brake Torque (T)\n\nThe braking torque is the difference in the tensions multiplied by the drum radius.\n\n$$\nT = (F_1 - F_2) \\cdot r\n$$\n\n$$\nT = (1680 \\text{ lb} - 654.7 \\text{ lb}) \\cdot (8 \\text{ in}) = (1025.3 \\text{ lb}) \\cdot (8 \\text{ in})\n$$\n\n$$\n\\boxed{T \\approx 8202.4 \\text{ lb-in}}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Find the Necessary Force (P)\n\nTo find the force $P$, we sum the moments about the lever's pivot point. The force $P$ creates a moment that must balance the moment created by the tight side tension $F_1$. The slack side tension $F_2$ is attached at the pivot, so its moment arm is zero.\n\nSum of moments about the pivot = 0:\n$$\n(P \\cdot L) - (F_1 \\cdot a) = 0\n$$\n\nSolving for P:\n$$\nP = \\frac{F_1 \\cdot a}{L}\n$$\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{(1680 \\text{ lb}) \\cdot (3 \\text{ in})}{10 \\text{ in}}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\boxed{P = 504 \\text{ lb}}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Find the Steady-State Power (H)\n\nThe power dissipated by the brake is calculated from the torque and the rotational speed. The common formula for horsepower (hp) is:\n\n$$\nH = \\frac{T \\cdot n}{63025}\n$$\n\nWhere $T$ is in lb-in and $n$ is in rev/min.\n\n$$\nH = \\frac{(8202.4 \\text{ lb-in}) \\cdot (200 \\text{ rev/min})}{63025}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\boxed{H \\approx 26.0 \\text{ hp}}\n$$"

These forces pull on the surface of the drum.\n2.  **Bearing Radial Load (`R`):** The bearings support the drum's shaft. They provide a reaction force, `R`, at the center of the drum that is equal and opposite to the vector sum of `F\u2081` and `F\u2082`. This keeps the drum in equilibrium.\n3.  **Rotation:** The drum has a counterclockwise (CCW) rotation. Friction will oppose this motion.\n\nHere is a representation of the FBD:\n*   Imagine a circle representing the drum.\n*   An arrow labeled `F\u2081` (tight tension) pulls on the drum.\n*   Another arrow labeled `F\u2082` (slack tension) pulls on the drum. `F\u2081` is larger than `F\u2082`.\n*   An arrow labeled `R` (bearing load) points from the center of the drum, balancing the pull from `F\u2081` and `F\u2082`.\n*   A curved arrow indicates the CCW direction of rotation.\n\n---\n\n### Finding the Bearing Radial Load\n\nThe bearing radial load (`R`) is the resultant force caused by the two band tensions, `F\u2081` and `F\u2082`. We can find it in three steps.\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate the Tight Side Tension (F\u2081)\n\nThe maximum tension (`F\u2081`) in the band is determined by the maximum allowable pressure (`p_max`) on the brake lining.\n\nThe formula is:\n```latex\nF\u2081 = p_{max} \\times w \\times r\n```\nWhere:\n*   `p_max` = Maximum pressure = 70 psi\n*   `w` = Width of the band = 3 in\n*   `r` = Radius of the drum = Diameter / 2 = 16 in / 2 = 8 in\n\nCalculation:\n```latex\nF\u2081 = 70 \\text{ psi} \\times 3 \\text{ in} \\times 8 \\text{ in} = 1680 \\text{ lb}\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate the Slack Side Tension (F\u2082)\n\nThe relationship between the tight and slack side tensions is given by the band brake equation:\n\n```latex\n\\frac{F\u2081}{F\u2082} = e^{f \\phi}\n```\nWhere:\n*   `f` = Coefficient of friction = 0.20\n*   `\\phi` = Angle of wrap of the band in radians.\n\nSince the figure is not provided, we will assume a standard wrap angle of **270\u00b0**, which is a common configuration for this type of brake.\n\n*   `\\phi = 270\u00b0 = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}` radians \u2248 4.712 rad\n\nNow, we can find `F\u2082`:\n```latex\n\\frac{1680 \\text{ lb}}{F\u2082} = e^{(0.20 \\times 4.712)} = e^{0.9424} \\approx 2.566\n```\n```latex\nF\u2082 = \\frac{1680 \\text{ lb}}{2.566} \\approx 654.7 \\text{ lb}\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate the Bearing Radial Load (R)\n\nThe bearing load `R` is the vector sum of `F\u2081` and `F\u2082`. For a 270\u00b0 wrap, the forces `F\u2081` and `F\u2082` act at a right angle (90\u00b0) to each other. We can find the resultant force using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n```latex\nR = \\sqrt{F\u2081^2 + F\u2082^2}\n```\nCalculation:\n```latex\nR = \\sqrt{(1680 \\text{ lb})^2 + (654.7 \\text{ lb})^2}\n```\n```latex\nR = \\sqrt{2,822,400 + 428,632}\n```\n```latex\nR = \\sqrt{3,251,032} \\approx 1803 \\text{ lb}\n```\n\nThe bearing radial load that the pair of bearings would have to carry is **1803 lb**."

For an induction motor driving a **light-shock machine**, a typical **Service Factor (K\u209b)** is 1.3.\n\n**Design Power = Rated Power \u00d7 K\u209b**\n$$\n\\text{Design Power} = 100 \\text{ hp} \\times 1.3 = 130 \\text{ hp}\n$$\nOur belt selection must be able to handle 130 hp.\n\n### **3. Select Pulley Diameters & Belt Speed**\n\nThe design process starts by selecting a diameter for the smaller (motor) pulley. A reasonable choice for a 100 hp motor at this speed is a 14-inch pulley.\n\n*   **Smaller Pulley Diameter (d):** 14 inches\n*   **Larger Pulley Diameter (D):**\n    $$\n    D = d \\times i = 14 \\text{ in} \\times 2 = 28 \\text{ inches}\n    $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the belt speed (V). It's best to keep this below 6000 ft/min.\n$$\nV = \\frac{\\pi \\times d \\times N_1}{12} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 14 \\text{ in} \\times 1140 \\text{ rpm}}{12 \\text{ in/ft}} \\approx 4178 \\text{ ft/min}\n$$\nThis speed is well within the acceptable range.\n\n### **4. Determine Belt Geometry**\n\n#### **Angle of Wrap (\u03b8)**\nThe angle of wrap on the smaller pulley determines how well the belt can grip. A smaller angle means less grip.\n\n$$\n\\theta = 180^\\circ - 2 \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{D-d}{2C}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\theta = 180^\\circ - 2 \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{28 - 14}{2 \\times 240}\\right) = 180^\\circ - 3.34^\\circ = 176.66^\\circ\n$$\nThis is an excellent angle of wrap, very close to the ideal 180\u00b0.\n\n#### **Belt Length (L)**\nWe need the total length of the belt to complete the selection.\n\n$$\nL = 2C + \\frac{\\pi}{2}(D+d) + \\frac{(D-d)^2}{4C}\n$$\n$$\nL = 2(240) + \\frac{\\pi}{2}(28+14) + \\frac{(28-14)^2}{4(240)}\n$$\n$$\nL = 480 + 65.97 + 0.20 = 546.17 \\text{ inches} \\approx 45.5 \\text{ ft}\n$$\n\n### **5. Select Belt Type and Width**\n\nThis is the final step. We will use a simplified \"horsepower rating\" method found in design handbooks.\n\n1.  **Choose a Belt Type:** For this high-power application, we'll select a **Heavy-Duty Synthetic or Rubber Belt**.\n\n2.  **Find the Rated Power:** From a manufacturer's catalog, a modern heavy-duty belt at a speed of ~4200 ft/min can transmit about **15 hp per inch of width**.\n\n3.  **Apply Correction Factor:** This rating is for an ideal 180\u00b0 wrap. Our angle is 176.7\u00b0. The correction factor for this angle (`C\u03b8`) is very close to 1, approximately **0.99**.\n\n4.  **Calculate Required Width (b):**\n    $$\n    \\text{Required Width} = \\frac{\\text{Design Power}}{\\text{Rated hp/in} \\times C_\\theta}\n    $$\n    $$\n    b = \\frac{130 \\text{ hp}}{15 \\text{ hp/in} \\times 0.99} \\approx 8.75 \\text{ inches}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Select a Standard Width:** We round up to the nearest standard belt width. A **9-inch** wide belt is a suitable choice.\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\n\nBased on the calculations, the selected flat belt drive system is:\n\n*   **Belt Type:** Heavy-Duty Synthetic/Rubber Flat Belt\n*   **Belt Width:** **9 inches**\n*   **Belt Length:** **546 inches (or 45.5 ft)**\n*   **Driver Pulley (d):** 14-inch diameter\n*   **Driven Pulley (D):** 28-inch diameter"

                                    "solution": "### **1. Find Rope Properties and List Given Data**\n\nFirst, we'll list the information given in the problem and find standard properties for the specified wire rope from tables (e.g., from a machine design textbook).\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Rope Type: 2-in, 6x19 Monitor-Steel\n*   Load, `W`: 4 tons = 4 \u00d7 2000 lbs = 8,000 lbs\n*   Depth, `L`: 480 ft\n*   Drum Diameter, `D_d`: 6 ft = 72 in\n*   Smallest Sheave Diameter, `D_s`: 3 ft = 36 in\n*   Acceleration, `a`: 2 ft/s\u00b2\n\n**Rope Properties (from standard tables):**\n*   Nominal Diameter, `d_r`: 2 in\n*   Weight per foot, `w_r`: 5.86 lb/ft\n*   Ultimate (Breaking) Strength, `S_u`: 342,000 lbs\n*   Approx. Metallic Area, `A_m`: 1.6 in\u00b2\n*   Approx. Wire Diameter, `d_w`: 0.125 in (for 6x19 class)\n*   Modulus of Elasticity of wire material, `E_w`: 29.5 \u00d7 10\u2076 psi\n\n---\n\n### **2. Calculate Loads on the Rope**\n\nThe total tensile force on the rope is the sum of the load being lifted, the rope's own weight, and the force needed for acceleration.\n\n**a) Load being lifted (W):**\nThis is the 4-ton load.\n`W = 8,000 lbs`\n\n**b) Weight of the Rope (W_r):**\nThe maximum rope weight occurs when the lift is at the bottom of the 480 ft shaft.\n```\nW_r = (Weight per foot) \u00d7 (Length)\nW_r = 5.86 lb/ft \u00d7 480 ft = 2,813 lbs\n```\n\n**c) Acceleration Force (F_a):**\nThis is the extra force needed to accelerate the load and the rope.\n```\nF_a = (Total Mass) \u00d7 (Acceleration) = ((W + W_r) / g) \u00d7 a\nF_a = ((8000 + 2813 lbs) / 32.2 ft/s\u00b2) \u00d7 2 ft/s\u00b2 = 672 lbs\n```\n\n**d) Total Tensile Load (F_t):**\nThis is the sum of all the forces pulling on the rope.\n```\nF_t = W + W_r + F_a\nF_t = 8000 + 2813 + 672 = 11,485 lbs\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Estimate the Stresses in the Rope**\n\nThe total stress is a combination of direct tension (from the loads above) and bending stress (from wrapping around the drum and sheaves).\n\n**a) Tensile Stress (\u03c3_t):**\nThis stress is caused by the total tensile load `F_t`.\n\n$$\n\\sigma_t = \\frac{F_t}{A_m} = \\frac{11,485 \\text{ lbs}}{1.6 \\text{ in}^2} = 7,178 \\text{ psi}\n$$\n\n**b) Bending Stress (\u03c3_b):**\nThe highest bending stress occurs when the rope bends around the *smallest* diameter, which is the 3-ft (36-in) sheave.\n\n$$\n\\sigma_b = \\frac{E_w \\cdot d_w}{D_s} = \\frac{(29.5 \\times 10^6 \\text{ psi}) \\cdot (0.125 \\text{ in})}{36 \\text{ in}} = 102,430 \\text{ psi}\n$$\n\n**c) Total Working Stress (\u03c3_total):**\nThis is the simple sum of the tensile and bending stresses.\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = \\sigma_t + \\sigma_b = 7,178 + 102,430 = 109,608 \\text{ psi}\n$$\n\n**Summary of Stresses:**\n*   **Tensile Stress:** 7,178 psi\n*   **Bending Stress:** 102,430 psi\n*   **Total Estimated Stress:** 109,608 psi\n\n---\n\n### **4. Estimate the Factors of Safety**\n\nWe can look at safety in a few ways. The most comprehensive method includes the effects of both tension and bending.\n\n**a) Factor of Safety for Tensile Load Only (N_op):**\nThis is a simple check that ignores the significant effect of bending.\n\n$$\nN_{op} = \\frac{\\text{Ultimate Strength}}{\\text{Total Tensile Load}} = \\frac{342,000 \\text{ lbs}}{11,485 \\text{ lbs}} \\approx 29.8\n$$\nWhile this number is high, it is misleading because it ignores bending stress.\n\n**b) Factor of Safety Including Bending (N_eq):**\nThis is the most realistic measure of safety. We create an \"equivalent load\" that includes the effect of bending and compare it to the rope's ultimate strength.\n\n*   **Equivalent Bending Load (F_b):**\n    `F_b = \u03c3_b \u00d7 A_m = 102,430 psi \u00d7 1.6 in\u00b2 = 163,888 lbs`\n\n*   **Total Equivalent Load (F_eq):**\n    `F_eq = F_t + F_b = 11,485 + 163,888 = 175,373 lbs`\n\n*   **Factor of Safety (N_eq):**\n\n$$\nN_{eq} = \\frac{\\text{Ultimate Strength}}{\\text{Total Equivalent Load}} = \\frac{342,000 \\text{ lbs}}{175,373 \\text{ lbs}} \\approx 1.95\n$$\n\n**Conclusion on Safety:**\nA factor of safety of **1.95** is very low for a mine hoist, where values of 5 to 8 are typically required for safety. The calculation shows that the extremely high **bending stress**, caused by the small 3-foot sheave, is the critical issue in this design."

                                    "solution": "Here is a step-by-step solution to select a suitable bearing.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Design Life in Revolutions (L\u2081\u2080)**\n\nFirst, we need to convert the desired life from hours into millions of revolutions, which is the standard unit for bearing life.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$\nL_{10} = \\frac{60 \\times n \\times L_h}{10^6} \\quad (\\text{in millions of revolutions})\n$$\n\nWhere:\n-   `L\u2081\u2080` = Rated life in millions of revolutions\n-   `n` = Speed in rev/min = 300 rpm\n-   `L_h` = Desired life in hours = 12,000 hours\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$$\nL_{10} = \\frac{60 \\times 300 \\times 12000}{10^6} = 216 \\text{ million revolutions}\n$$\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Equivalent Dynamic Load (P)**\n\nSince the bearing is subjected to both radial and axial loads, we must calculate a single \"equivalent\" load that represents their combined effect.\n\nThe formula for the equivalent dynamic load is:\n$$\nP = X V F_r + Y F_a\n$$\n\nWhere:\n-   `P` = Equivalent dynamic load\n-   `F_r` = Radial load = 10 kN\n-   `F_a` = Axial load = 5 kN\n-   `V` = Rotation factor. For an industrial motor where the inner ring rotates, `V = 1`.\n-   `X` = Radial load factor\n-   `Y` = Axial (thrust) load factor\n\nTo find `X` and `Y`, we need to choose a bearing type. A **single-row deep groove ball bearing** is a versatile and common choice for this application. The factors `X` and `Y` for this bearing depend on the ratio of axial to radial load (`F_a / F_r`).\n\nCalculate the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{F_a}{F_r} = \\frac{5 \\text{ kN}}{10 \\text{ kN}} = 0.5\n$$\nThis ratio (0.5) is significant. For deep groove ball bearings with a significant axial load, typical values for the factors are `X = 0.56` and `Y` is approximately `1.4`. We will use these for our calculation.\n\nNow, calculate `P`:\n$$\nP = (0.56 \\times 1 \\times 10) + (1.4 \\times 5) = 5.6 + 7.0 = 12.6 \\text{ kN}\n$$\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Required Dynamic Load Rating (C\u2081\u2080)**\n\nThe dynamic load rating (`C\u2081\u2080`) is the load a bearing can carry for one million revolutions. We can calculate the required `C\u2081\u2080` for our specific life goal using the following relation:\n$$\nC_{10} = P \\times (L_{10})^{\\frac{1}{k}}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n-   `C\u2081\u2080` = Required basic dynamic load rating\n-   `P` = Equivalent dynamic load = 12.6 kN\n-   `L\u2081\u2080` = Life in millions of revolutions = 216\n-   `k` = Life exponent. For ball bearings, `k = 3`.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$$\nC_{10} = 12.6 \\times (216)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\n$$\n$$\nC_{10} = 12.6 \\times 6 = 75.6 \\text{ kN}\n$$\n\n### **Step 4: Bearing Selection**\n\nThe final step is to select a bearing from a manufacturer's catalog that meets our requirement.\n\n**Requirement:** We need a single-row deep groove ball bearing with a dynamic load rating `C` that is **equal to or greater than 75.6 kN**.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n1.  Open a bearing catalog (e.g., from SKF, FAG, NSK).\n2.  Go to the section for single-row deep groove ball bearings.\n3.  Look for a bearing that has a `C` value of at least 75.6 kN. You will also need to know the motor shaft diameter to select the correct bore size.\n\n**Example Selection:**\nWithout a specific shaft diameter, we can look at a standard series. A **6312** deep groove ball bearing typically has a dynamic load rating of around `81.9 kN`.\n\nSince `81.9 kN > 75.6 kN`, this bearing would be a suitable choice.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nSelect a **single-row deep groove ball bearing** with a basic dynamic load rating `C\u2081\u2080` of at least **75.6 kN**. A bearing such as a **6312** would be a suitable candidate, pending confirmation of the shaft diameter."

A common starting point is to make the length equal to the diameter.\n\n*   **Assumption:** Let the length-to-diameter ratio `L/d = 1`.\n*   Bearing Length, `L = 1 \u00d7 d = 75 mm`\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate Bearing Pressure (P)**\n\nPressure is the load distributed over the projected area of the bearing.\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{W}{L \\times d}\n$$\n\n*   `P = 10,000 N / (75 mm \\times 75 mm) = 1.78 N/mm\u00b2` or `1.78 MPa`\n\n### **Step 4: Select Lubricant and Estimate Operating Viscosity**\n\nThe bearing starts at 40\u00b0C but will heat up during operation. We need to estimate its average running temperature to find the oil viscosity.\n\n*   **Assumption:** Let's select **SAE 30** oil.\n*   **Assumption:** Let's assume an average oil film temperature of **`T_avg = 60\u00b0C`**.\n*   From standard charts, the absolute viscosity (`\u03bc`) of SAE 30 oil at 60\u00b0C is approximately `24 cP` (centiPoise).\n*   `\u03bc = 24 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 Pa\u00b7s` or `24 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 N\u00b7s/mm\u00b2`\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Sommerfeld Number (S)**\n\nThe Sommerfeld number is a key dimensionless value used to find all other bearing characteristics from design charts.\n\n$$\nS = \\left( \\frac{r}{c} \\right)^2 \\frac{\\mu n}{P}\n$$\n\n*   First, the clearance ratio: `r/c = 37.5 mm / 0.0375 mm = 1000`\n*   Now, calculate S (make sure all units are consistent, here using N and mm):\n    $$\n    S = (1000)^2 \\times \\frac{(24 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ N\u00b7s/mm}^2) \\times (23.33 \\text{ rps})}{1.78 \\text{ N/mm}^2} \\approx 0.314\n    $$\n\n### **Step 6: Find Performance Parameters from Charts**\n\nUsing our calculated Sommerfeld number (`S = 0.314`) and our `L/d = 1` ratio, we look up the bearing performance characteristics from standard design charts (e.g., Raimondi-Boyd charts).\n\n*   From the charts for `S = 0.314` and `L/d = 1`:\n    *   **Minimum Film Thickness Variable:** `(h_o / c) \u2248 0.62`\n    *   **Friction Variable:** `(r / c)f \u2248 7.0`\n\n### **Step 7: Calculate Minimum Film Thickness (`h_o`)**\n\nNow we can find the actual minimum thickness of the oil film, which prevents metal-to-metal contact.\n\n$$\nh_o = \\left( \\frac{h_o}{c} \\right) \\times c\n$$\n\n*   `h_o = 0.62 \u00d7 0.0375 mm = 0.023 mm`\n\n**Check:** This value is generally considered safe for most machinery, so our design is acceptable in terms of film thickness.\n\n### **Step 8: Calculate Heat Generated (`H_g`)**\n\nFriction in the oil film generates heat. We need to calculate how much.\n\n1.  **Find the coefficient of friction (`f`)**:\n    $$\n    f = \\frac{\\text{Friction Variable}}{(r/c)} = \\frac{7.0}{1000} = 0.007\n    $$\n2.  **Calculate Power Loss (Heat Generated)**:\n    $$\n    H_g = \\frac{2 \\pi N (fWr)}{60}\n    $$\n    *Note: Convert radius `r` to meters (0.0375 m) for the result to be in Watts.*\n    $$\n    H_g = \\frac{2 \\pi \\times 1400 \\times (0.007 \\times 10,000 \\times 0.0375)}{60} = 384.8 \\text{ Watts}\n    $$\n\n### **Step 9: Check if the Bearing Can Cool Itself (Heat Dissipation `H_d`)**\n\nWe must check if the heat generated (`H_g`) can be removed naturally.

                                    "solution": "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the minimum shaft diameter.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Forces on the Gear\n\nFirst, we need to find the forces acting on the gear at point D. The shaft transmits a torque `T = 340 N-m`. This torque is created by a tangential force, `F_t`, on the gear tooth.\n\n*   Torque, `T = 340 N-m = 340,000 N-mm`\n*   Gear pitch diameter, `D_g = 150 mm`, so the radius is `r_g = 75 mm`.\n\nThe tangential force is:\n```\nF_t = T / r_g = 340,000 N-mm / 75 mm = 4533 N\n```\nThe gear force also has a radial component, `F_r`, due to the 20\u00b0 pressure angle:\n```\nF_r = F_t * tan(20\u00b0) = 4533 N * 0.364 = 1650 N\n```\n\nThese two forces, `F_t` and `F_r`, act at point D and will bend the shaft.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Bending Moments\n\nThe shaft is supported by bearings at B and C, acting as a simple beam. We need to find the maximum bending moment, which will occur at bearing C.\n\n1.  **Bending due to Tangential Force (`F_t`) in the vertical plane:**\n    The moment at C is `M_y = F_t * (distance CD) = 4533 N * 100 mm = 453,300 N-mm`.\n\n2.  **Bending due to Radial Force (`F_r`) in the horizontal plane:**\n    The moment at C is `M_z = F_r * (distance CD) = 1650 N * 100 mm = 165,000 N-mm`.\n\nThe total resultant bending moment at C is the vector sum of these two moments:\n```\nM = sqrt(M_y^2 + M_z^2) = sqrt((453,300)^2 + (165,000)^2)\nM = 482,400 N-mm\n```\nThis bending moment `M` is fully reversing as the shaft rotates, so it is the **alternating moment**, `M_a`. The torque `T` is constant, so it is the **mean torque**, `T_m`.\n\n*   `M_a = 482,400 N-mm`\n*   `T_m = 340,000 N-mm`\n\n### Step 3: Determine Material Properties and Endurance Limit\n\nFor **AISI 1040 Steel**, we'll use typical properties (assuming hot-rolled condition):\n*   Ultimate Tensile Strength, `S_ut = 620 MPa`\n*   Yield Strength, `S_y = 420 MPa`\n\nNext, we find the shaft's endurance limit, `S_e`, by applying modification factors (Marin factors) to the theoretical endurance limit (`S'_e`).\n\n*   **Theoretical Endurance Limit:** `S'_e = 0.5 * S_ut = 0.5 * 620 = 310 MPa`\n\n*   **Marin Factors:**\n    *   `k_a` (Surface Finish): For a machined shaft, `k_a \u2248 0.76` (using standard formula `k_a = a * S_{ut}^b`).\n    *   `k_b` (Size): We don't know the diameter yet, so we'll start with a reasonable assumption of `k_b = 0.85` and can check it later.\n    *   `k_c` (Load): For bending, `k_c = 1`.\n    *   `k_e` (Reliability): Assuming 99% reliability, `k_e = 0.814`.\n\n*   **Corrected Endurance Limit (`S_e`):**\n    `S_e = k_a * k_b * k_c * k_e * S'_e`\n    `S_e = 0.76 * 0.85 * 1 * 0.814 * 310 = 163 MPa`\n\n### Step 4: Determine Stress Concentration Factors\n\nThe problem states \"sharp fillet radii at the bearing shoulders\". A sharp change in geometry causes stress concentration, which is critical for fatigue life.\n\n*   For a sharp fillet, we'll assume high (but realistic) stress concentration factors.\n    *   Bending: `K_f = 2.5`\n    *   Torsion: `K_{fs} = 2.0`\n\n### Step 5: Apply Fatigue Failure Theory to Find Diameter\n\nWe will use the **Goodman fatigue criterion** to find the minimum diameter `d`. This method safely combines the effects of the alternating bending stress and the constant torsional stress.\n\nThe standard design equation for a solid round shaft under these conditions is:\n\n$$\nd^3 = \\frac{16n}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{2K_f M_a}{S_e} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3} K_{fs} T_m}{S_{ut}} \\right]\n$$\n\nWhere:\n*   `d` = minimum shaft diameter (mm)\n*   `n` = Factor of Safety (we use `n=1` for the \"minimum allowable\" diameter)\n*   `M_a` = Alternating moment = 482,400 N-mm\n*   `T_m` = Mean torque = 340,000 N-mm\n*   `K_f`, `K_{fs}` = Stress concentration factors (2.5 and 2.0)\n*   `S_e` = Endurance limit = 163 MPa\n*   `S_{ut}` = Ultimate strength = 620 MPa\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n\n$$\nd^3 = \\frac{16(1)}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{2(2.5)(482,400)}{163} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}(2.0)(340,000)}{620} \\right]\n$$\n\n$$\nd^3 = 5.093 \\left[ 14,800 + 1,900 \\right]\n$$\n\n$$\nd^3 = 5.093 [16,700] = 85,050 \\text{ mm}^3\n$$\n\nSolving for `d`:\n\n$$\nd = \\sqrt[3]{85,050} = 43.98 \\text{ mm}\n$$\n\nRounding up to a practical size, the minimum allowable diameter for this section of the shaft is **44 mm**.\n\n*(Self-check: Our calculated diameter of 44 mm is in the range where our assumed size factor `k_b = 0.85` is valid, so no further iteration is needed for this level of analysis.)*"

The component with the lower strength is considered the weaker part.\n\n### 1. The Bending Strength Concept\n\nThe bending strength of a gear tooth (`S_b`) is proportional to the product of its allowable bending stress (`\u03c3_b`) and its Lewis Form Factor (`Y`).\n\n$$\nS_b \\propto \\sigma_b \\times Y\n$$\n\nWe will compare this value for both the pinion and the gear. The one with the smaller `\u03c3_b \\times Y` product is weaker.\n\n### 2. Allowable Bending Stress (`\u03c3_b`)\n\n*   Both the pinion and the gear are made from the same material (steel at 200 BHN).\n*   Therefore, their material properties, including the allowable bending stress (`\u03c3_b`), will be the same.\n*   This means we can write: `(\u03c3_b)_pinion = (\u03c3_b)_gear`.\n\n### 3. Lewis Form Factor (`Y`)\n\nSince the allowable stress is the same for both, the weaker part will be the one with the smaller **Lewis Form Factor (Y)**. This factor depends on the number of teeth (`Z`) and the pressure angle (20\u00b0).\n\nA common formula to find the Lewis Form Factor `Y` for a 20\u00b0 pressure angle is:\n\n$$\nY = \\pi \\left( 0.154 - \\frac{0.912}{Z} \\right)\n$$\n\n### 4. Calculation and Comparison\n\nLet's calculate `Y` for both the pinion and the gear.\n\n**For the Pinion:**\n*   Number of teeth, `Z_p = 20`\n\n$$\nY_p = \\pi \\left( 0.154 - \\frac{0.912}{20} \\right) = \\pi (0.154 - 0.0456) = \\pi (0.1084) \\approx 0.340\n$$\n\n**For the Gear:**\n*   Number of teeth, `Z_g = 36`\n\n$$\nY_g = \\pi \\left( 0.154 - \\frac{0.912}{36} \\right) = \\pi (0.154 - 0.0253) = \\pi (0.1287) \\approx 0.404\n$$\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   `Y_p = 0.340`\n*   `Y_g = 0.404`\n\nSince `0.340 < 0.404`, the Lewis Form Factor for the pinion (`Y_p`) is smaller than that for the gear (`Y_g`).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBecause both gears are made of the same material, the one with the smaller Lewis Form Factor is weaker in bending. Our calculation shows that the pinion has the smaller form factor.\n\n**Therefore, the pinion is the weaker part based on bending.**"

We use an \"equivalent\" coefficient of friction, $\\mu'$, for a more accurate calculation.\n\nThe formula for the equivalent coefficient of friction is:\n$$\n\\mu' = \\frac{4\\mu \\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\theta + \\sin\\theta}\n$$\nHere, the wrap angle $\\theta = 90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians.\n\nLet's calculate the constant part of the formula:\n*   $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ rad\n*   $\\theta/2 = 45^\\circ$\n*   $\\sin(\\theta/2) = \\sin(45^\\circ) \\approx 0.707$\n*   $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sin(90^\\circ) = 1$\n\n$$\n\\frac{4 \\sin(45^\\circ)}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\sin(90^\\circ)} = \\frac{4 \\times 0.707}{1.571 + 1} = \\frac{2.828}{2.571} \\approx 1.1\n$$\nSo, $\\mu' \\approx 1.1 \\times \\mu$.\n\nNow, we find the range for $\\mu'$:\n*   $\\mu'_{max} = 1.1 \\times \\mu_{max} = 1.1 \\times 0.325 = 0.358$\n*   $\\mu'_{min} = 1.1 \\times \\mu_{min} = 1.1 \\times 0.175 = 0.193$\n\n### Step 3: Find the Normal Force (N) on the Brake Block\n\nThe normal force is the force pressing the block against the drum. We find it by balancing the moments on the lever.\n\n*   **Actuating Force, P**: 400 N\n*   **Lever arm for P**: $8 + 12 = 20$ units\n*   **Lever arm for N**: $8$ units\n\n***Assumption***: *Since the direction of rotation is not given, we will assume the simplest case where the frictional force does not create a turning moment on the lever arm. This gives a direct relationship between the actuating force (P) and the normal force (N).*\n\nBalancing moments about the pivot point:\n$$\nP \\times (\\text{Total Lever Arm}) = N \\times (\\text{Block Lever Arm})\n$$\n$$\n400 \\text{ N} \\times 20 = N \\times 8\n$$\nSolving for the Normal Force, N:\n$$\nN = \\frac{400 \\times 20}{8} = 1000 \\text{ N}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Braking Torques ($T_b$)\n\nBraking torque is the product of the tangential frictional force ($F_f$) and the drum radius (R). The frictional force is $F_f = \\mu' \\times N$.\n\n***Note***: *The drum radius is unclearly labeled as '6R' in the problem description. Without a specific value, the final answer will be in terms of 'R'. You should express R in meters (m) to get the torque in Newton-meters (N\u00b7m).*\n\n**Maximum Braking Torque ($T_{b,max}$)**:\nThis occurs with the maximum friction, $\\mu'_{max}$.\n*   $F_{f,max} = \\mu'_{max} \\times N = 0.358 \\times 1000 \\text{ N} = 358 \\text{ N}$\n*   $T_{b,max} = F_{f,max} \\times R = 358 \\times R$\n\n**Minimum Braking Torque ($T_{b,min}$)**:\nThis occurs with the minimum friction, $\\mu'_{min}$.\n*   $F_{f,min} = \\mu'_{min} \\times N = 0.193 \\times 1000 \\text{ N} = 193 \\text{ N}$\n*   $T_{b,min} = F_{f,min} \\times R = 193 \\times R$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe brake torques corresponding to $\\pm 3\\hat{\\sigma}_f$ are:\n*   **Maximum Brake Torque:** $T_{b,max} = 358 \\cdot R$ N\u00b7m\n*   **Minimum Brake Torque:** $T_{b,min} = 193 \\cdot R$ N\u00b7m\n\n(where **R** is the radius of the brake drum in meters)."

The design power is the input power multiplied by a service factor (K_s). For a smooth load from an electric motor, the base service factor is 1.0. We will use the given design factor of 1.1.\n\n*   **Service Factor (K_s):** 1.1\n\n$$\n\\text{Design Power} = P \\times K_s\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{Design Power} = 50 \\text{ hp} \\times 1.1 = 55 \\text{ hp}\n$$\nOur chain must be able to handle **55 hp**.\n\n### Step 3: Select the Roller Chain\n\nTo select a chain, we refer to a standard chain rating table from a design data book. We look for a chain that can handle at least **55 hp** at the small sprocket's speed (**1800 rpm**) and tooth count (**19 teeth**).\n\nLet's check a standard **ANSI 80 roller chain** (which has a 1-inch pitch).\n\n*   From a typical rating chart, an **ANSI 80 chain** with a **19-tooth sprocket** at **1800 rpm** has a power rating of approximately **61 hp**.\n\nSince the chain's rated power (61 hp) is greater than our design power (55 hp), this chain is a suitable choice.\n\n*   **Selected Chain:** **ANSI 80 Roller Chain**\n*   **Chain Pitch (p):** 1.0 inch\n\n***Note:*** *The 50,000-hour life is very high (standard ratings are often for ~15,000 hours). Our choice is conservative (61 hp > 55 hp), which helps achieve a longer life. For such a demanding life requirement, a multi-strand chain could also be considered, but a heavy-duty single-strand chain is a good starting point.*\n\n### Step 4: Determine Sprocket Diameters and Center Distance\n\nNow we calculate the pitch circle diameters (d1 and d2) for our sprockets.\n\n$$\nd = \\frac{p}{\\sin(180^\\circ / z)}\n$$\n\n*   **Small Sprocket Diameter (d1):**\n    $$\n    d_1 = \\frac{1.0\"}{\\sin(180^\\circ / 19)} = \\frac{1.0\"}{\\sin(9.47^\\circ)} = 6.07 \\text{ inches}\n    $$\n*   **Large Sprocket Diameter (d2):**\n    $$\n    d_2 = \\frac{1.0\"}{\\sin(180^\\circ / 38)} = \\frac{1.0\"}{\\sin(4.74^\\circ)} = 12.11 \\text{ inches}\n    $$\n\nNext, we set a reasonable center distance (C). A good rule of thumb is 30 to 50 times the chain pitch.\n\n*   Let's choose **C = 40 \u00d7 pitch**\n    $$\n    C = 40 \\times 1.0\" = 40 \\text{ inches}\n    $$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Chain Length\n\nWe calculate the chain length in pitches (Lp) and then round it to the nearest even number.\n\n$$\nL_p = 2 \\left( \\frac{C}{p} \\right) + \\frac{z_1 + z_2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{z_2 - z_1}{2\\pi} \\right)^2}{\\left( \\frac{C}{p} \\right)}\n$$\n\n$$\nL_p = 2 \\left( \\frac{40}{1} \\right) + \\frac{19 + 38}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{38 - 19}{2\\pi} \\right)^2}{\\left( \\frac{40}{1} \\right)}\n$$\n\n$$\nL_p = 80 + 28.5 + \\frac{(3.02)^2}{40} = 108.5 + 0.23 = 108.73 \\text{ pitches}\n$$\n\nWe must use an even number of pitches. So, we round up to **Lp = 110 pitches**.\nThe total length of the chain is:\n\n$$\nL = L_p \\times p = 110 \\times 1.0\" = 110 \\text{ inches}\n$$\n\n### Step 6: Specify Lubrication\n\nFor a high-speed (1800 rpm) and high-power (50 hp) drive, proper lubrication is critical for achieving a long life.\n\n*   **Required Lubrication Type:** **Type C (Oil Stream)**. This involves a pump delivering a continuous stream of oil to the chain.\n\n---\n\n### Final Design Summary\n\nHere is the specification for the chain-sprocket system:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Chain Type** | **ANSI 80 Roller Chain** |\n| **Chain Pitch (p)** | 1.0 inch |\n| **Chain Length (L)** | 110 inches (110 pitches) |\n| **Small Sprocket (z1)** | 19 teeth (Pitch Diameter \u2248 6.07 in) |\n| **Large Sprocket (z2)** | 38 teeth (Pitch Diameter \u2248 12.11 in) |\n| **Center Distance (C)** | Approx. 40 inches |\n| **Lubrication** | **Type C (Oil Stream Lubrication)** |"

Calculate Basic Gear Parameters**\n\nFirst, we need to find the basic operational values for the gears.\n\n*   **Diametral Pitch (`P_d`)**: This tells us the size of the teeth.\n    $$\n    P_d = \\frac{\\text{Number of Teeth (N)}}{\\text{Pitch Diameter (d)}} = \\frac{30}{6 \\text{ in}} = 5 \\text{ teeth/inch}\n    $$\n\n*   **Pitch-Line Velocity (`v`)**: This is the speed of the gear at the pitch circle.\n    $$\n    v = \\frac{\\pi \\cdot d \\cdot n}{12} = \\frac{\\pi \\cdot (6 \\text{ in}) \\cdot (600 \\text{ rpm})}{12} = 942.5 \\text{ ft/min}\n    $$\n\n### **2. Determine AGMA Strength Factors**\n\nNext, we find the various factors used in the AGMA strength equation. These factors adjust the calculation for real-world conditions.\n\n*   **Allowable Bending Stress (`S_t`)**: This is the maximum stress the material can handle. For through-hardened steel with 180 BHN, the AGMA bending strength (`S'_{t}`) is approximately **25,000 psi**. The allowable stress is modified by life and reliability factors.\n    *   **Life Factor (`Y_N`)**: For a life of 10\u2077 cycles, `Y_N = 1.0`.\n    *   **Reliability Factor (`K_R` or `Y_R`)**: For 99% reliability, `K_R = 1.0`.\n    *   **Temperature Factor (`K_T` or `Y_T`)**: Assumed `K_T = 1.0` for normal operating temperatures.\n\n    Therefore, the allowable bending stress is:\n    $$\n    S_t = \\frac{S'_{t} \\cdot Y_N}{K_R \\cdot K_T} = \\frac{25,000 \\cdot 1.0}{1.0 \\cdot 1.0} = 25,000 \\text{ psi}\n    $$\n\n*   **Geometry Factor (`J`)**: This factor depends on the tooth shape. For a 30-tooth straight bevel gear mating with another 30-tooth gear, we find from AGMA charts that `J \\approx 0.21`.\n\n*   **Overload Factor (`K_o`)**: This accounts for shock loads from the power source or driven machine. For general-purpose use with an assumed uniform power source and moderate shock at the driven end, a typical value is `K_o = 1.25`.\n\n*   **Dynamic Factor (`K_v`)**: This accounts for inaccuracies in the gear teeth, which cause extra forces at high speeds. It depends on the quality number (`Q_v = 6`) and pitch-line velocity (`v = 942.5` ft/min). Using the AGMA formula, we get `K_v \\approx 1.41`.\n\n*   **Load Distribution Factor (`K_m`)**: This accounts for how the load is distributed across the face width of the gear. For uncrowned teeth and a face width of 1.2 inches in a standard industrial application, a reasonable value is `K_m = 1.3`.\n\n*   **Other Factors**:\n    *   Size Factor (`K_s`): We assume `K_s = 1.0` as the gear is not unusually large.\n    *   Rim Thickness Factor (`K_B`): We assume the gear rim is properly designed, so `K_B = 1.0`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Allowable Tangential Load (`W_t`)**\n\nNow, we use the AGMA bending strength equation to find the maximum tangential force the gear can transmit.\n\n$$\nW_t = \\frac{S_t \\cdot F \\cdot J}{P_d \\cdot K_o \\cdot K_v \\cdot K_m}\n$$\n\nPlugging in our values:\n\n$$\nW_t = \\frac{(25,000 \\text{ psi}) \\cdot (1.2 \\text{ in}) \\cdot (0.21)}{(5) \\cdot (1.25) \\cdot (1.41) \\cdot (1.3)} = \\frac{6300}{11.46} \\approx 550 \\text{ lbf}\n$$\n\n### **4. Calculate the Power Rating (`P`)**\n\nFinally, we convert the allowable tangential load into a power rating in horsepower (hp).\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{W_t \\cdot v}{33,000}\n$$\n\nUsing the values for `W_t` and `v`:\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{(550 \\text{ lbf}) \\cdot (942.5 \\text{ ft/min})}{33,000} \\approx 15.7 \\text{ hp}\n$$\n\nThe power rating for the bevel gear pair based on AGMA bending strength is approximately **15.7 hp**."

We need to convert our 95% reliability requirement into an equivalent 90% reliability life.\n\nFirst, find the required life in hours at 90% reliability:\n$$\nL_{10h} = \\frac{\\text{Desired Life}}{a_1} = \\frac{12,000 \\text{ hours}}{0.62} = 19,355 \\text{ hours}\n$$\nNext, convert this life from hours into millions of revolutions:\n$$\nL_{10} = \\frac{L_{10h} \\times n \\times 60}{10^6} = \\frac{19,355 \\times 300 \\times 60}{10^6} = 348.4 \\text{ million revolutions}\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Equivalent Dynamic Load ($P_e$)\n\nThe equivalent load combines radial and axial loads into a single value. The formula is:\n$$\nP_e = (X V F_r + Y F_a) K_a\n$$\nThe factors $X$ and $Y$ depend on the bearing's geometry and the load ratio. Since we haven't chosen a bearing yet, we'll start with a good estimate.\n\n*   Calculate the load ratio: $\\frac{F_a}{F_r} = \\frac{5 \\text{ kN}}{10 \\text{ kN}} = 0.5$.\n*   Since this ratio is high, we can assume $X = 0.56$ and make an initial guess for $Y$, say $Y=1.7$.\n\nNow, calculate our first estimate of $P_e$:\n$$\nP_e = (0.56 \\times 1 \\times 10 \\text{ kN} + 1.7 \\times 5 \\text{ kN}) \\times 1.2\n$$\n$$\nP_e = (5.6 + 8.5) \\times 1.2 = 14.1 \\times 1.2 = 16.92 \\text{ kN}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Required Dynamic Load Rating ($C_{10}$)\n\nThis is the load capacity the bearing must have to achieve the desired life.

Calculate the ratio $\\frac{F_a}{C_0} = \\frac{5 \\text{ kN}}{100 \\text{ kN}} = 0.05$.\n2.  Using this ratio and a standard bearing data table, we find the interpolation factor `e`. For $\\frac{F_a}{C_0} = 0.05$, the value of $e \\approx 0.25$.\n3.  Compare $\\frac{F_a}{F_r}$ to $e$:\n    *   $\\frac{F_a}{F_r} = 0.5$\n    *   Since $0.5 > e (0.25)$, our choice of $X=0.56$ was correct.

                                    "solution": "Here is a step-by-step solution to the V-belt design problem.\n\n### **1. Find the Design Power**\n\nFirst, we need to adjust the engine's power to account for the working conditions. We do this using a **Service Factor (K_s)**. The service factor depends on the type of driver (IC engine), the driven machine (brick maker), and the daily operating hours (two shifts, ~16 hours/day).\n\nBased on standard design tables for these conditions (heavy-duty driver, medium shock load, >10 hours/day), a suitable service factor is **K_s = 1.5**.\n\nThe Design Power (P_d) is calculated as:\n$$\nP_d = \\text{Actual Power} \\times K_s\n$$\n$$\nP_d = 44.75 \\, \\text{kW} \\times 1.5 = 67.13 \\, \\text{kW}\n$$\n\n### **2. Select the V-Belt Cross-Section**\n\nWe choose the belt type (A, B, C, D, or E) based on the design power (67.13 kW) and the speed of the faster pulley (400 rpm).\n\nUsing a standard V-belt selection chart, these values fall into the region for a **'C' section V-belt**.\n\n### **3. Determine Belt and Drive Geometry**\n\n*   **Sheave Diameter (D):** Given as 660 mm. Since only one size is mentioned, we assume both sheaves are the same, so the speed ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Center Distance (C):** Given as 3.65 m or 3650 mm.\n*   **Belt Length (L):** We calculate the approximate length required. For drives with equal-sized sheaves, the formula is:\n    $$\n    L = 2C + \\pi D\n    $$\n    $$\n    L = 2(3650) + \\pi(660) = 7300 + 2073 = 9373 \\, \\text{mm}\n    $$\n    We must choose the nearest standard belt length. For a 'C' section belt, a standard length is **C360**, which means a nominal length of 360 inches (9144 mm). This length is suitable, and the center distance can be adjusted accordingly.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Number of Belts Needed**\n\n**a. Find the Power Rating per Belt:**\nThe power one 'C' section belt can handle depends on the sheave diameter and speed. From design data tables, a single 'C' belt on a 660 mm sheave at 400 rpm has a basic power rating of approximately **P_r = 15.5 kW**.\n\n**b. Apply Correction Factors:**\nWe adjust this basic rating with two factors:\n*   **Length Correction Factor (F_c):** For a standard C360 belt, this factor is approximately **F_c = 1.12**.\n*   **Arc of Contact Correction Factor (F_d):** The arc of contact is the angle the belt wraps around the pulley. Since both sheaves are the same size, the wrap is a full 180\u00b0. For a 180\u00b0 wrap, the correction factor is **F_d = 1.0**.\n\n**c. Calculate Corrected Power per Belt (P_a):**\n$$\nP_a = P_r \\times F_c \\times F_d\n$$\n$$\nP_a = 15.5 \\, \\text{kW} \\times 1.12 \\times 1.0 = 17.36 \\, \\text{kW/belt}\n$$\n\n**d. Calculate the Number of Belts (N):**\nNow, we divide the total design power by the power each belt can handle.\n$$\nN = \\frac{\\text{Design Power}}{\\text{Corrected Power per Belt}} = \\frac{67.13 \\, \\text{kW}}{17.36 \\, \\text{kW/belt}} = 3.87 \\, \\text{belts}\n$$\nWe must always round up to the next whole number. Therefore, we need **4 belts**.\n\n### **5. Final Selection and Factor of Safety**\n\n**V-Belt Arrangement:**\nThe final selection for the drive is:\n*   **Belt Type:** 4 parallel 'C' section V-belts (Standard length C360).\n*   **Sheaves:** Two 660 mm diameter sheaves.\n\n**Factor of Safety (FOS):**\nThe factor of safety is the ratio of the total power the selected belts *can* transmit to the *actual* power required by the engine. This shows the safety margin of our design.\n$$\n\\text{Total Power Capacity} = N \\times P_a = 4 \\, \\text{belts} \\times 17.36 \\, \\text{kW/belt} = 69.44 \\, \\text{kW}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{FOS} = \\frac{\\text{Total Power Capacity}}{\\text{Actual Power}} = \\frac{69.44 \\, \\text{kW}}{44.75 \\, \\text{kW}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{FOS} = 1.55\n$$\nThis factor of safety is essentially equal to our initial service factor, confirming that the design is appropriate for the demanding application."

                                    "solution": "To find the power rating, we need to determine the maximum tangential force ($W_t$) the gearset can handle. This is limited by either the **bending strength** of the teeth (resisting breaking off) or the **wear strength** of the tooth surfaces (resisting pitting and wear). We'll calculate the allowable load for both and use the lower value to find the power rating.\n\n### 1. Basic Geometric and Velocity Calculations\n\nFirst, let's find the pinion's pitch diameter ($d_p$) and the pitch-line velocity ($V_t$).\n\n*   **Pinion Pitch Diameter ($d_p$)**:\n    $$ d_p = \\frac{N_p}{P_d} = \\frac{17}{12} = 1.417 \\text{ in} $$\n*   **Pitch-Line Velocity ($V_t$)**: This is the linear speed of the gear teeth at the pitch circle.\n    $$ V_t = \\frac{\\pi d_p n_p}{12} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 1.417 \\text{ in} \\times 525 \\text{ rpm}}{12 \\text{ in/ft}} = 194.7 \\text{ ft/min} $$\n\n### 2. Bending Strength Analysis (Lewis Equation)\n\nThis analysis determines the force the gear teeth can withstand without breaking.\n\n*   **Allowable Bending Stress ($S_{at}$)**: We estimate the material's endurance limit. A common approximation for steel is half of the ultimate tensile strength.\n    $$ S_{at} \\approx 0.5 \\times S_{ut} = 0.5 \\times 76,000 \\text{ psi} = 38,000 \\text{ psi} $$\n*   **Lewis Form Factor ($Y$)**: This factor accounts for the tooth shape. Since the pinion has fewer teeth, it is generally weaker, so we calculate for the pinion. For a 20\u00b0 pressure angle:\n    $$ Y = 0.484 - \\frac{2.87}{N_p} = 0.484 - \\frac{2.87}{17} = 0.315 $$\n*   **Velocity Factor ($K_v$)**: This factor accounts for dynamic effects due to speed and tooth quality. For milled teeth:\n    $$ K_v = \\frac{600}{600 + V_t} = \\frac{600}{600 + 194.7} = 0.755 $$\n*   **Allowable Tangential Load (Bending)**: Now we combine these factors to find the maximum safe load based on bending strength.\n    $$ W_{t, \\text{bending}} = \\frac{S_{at} F Y K_v}{P_d N_d} $$\n    $$ W_{t, \\text{bending}} = \\frac{(38,000 \\text{ psi}) \\times (0.875 \\text{ in}) \\times (0.315) \\times (0.755)}{(12 \\text{ teeth/in}) \\times 2.25} = 293 \\text{ lb} $$\n\n### 3. Wear Strength Analysis (Buckingham's Equation)\n\nThis analysis determines the force the tooth surfaces can withstand without pitting or excessive wear. This is highly dependent on the material's hardness.\n\n*   **Surface Endurance Limit ($S_c$)**: This is estimated from the Brinell hardness (BHN).\n    $$ S_c = (0.4 \\times \\text{BHN} - 10) \\text{ kpsi} = (0.4 \\times 149 - 10) = 49.6 \\text{ kpsi} = 49,600 \\text{ psi} $$\n*   **Elastic Coefficient ($E$):** For steel, Young's Modulus is $E = 30 \\times 10^6$ psi.\n*   **Load-Stress Factor ($K$)**: This combines material properties and pressure angle.\n    $$ K = \\frac{S_c^2 \\sin\\phi}{1.4} \\left( \\frac{1}{E_p} + \\frac{1}{E_g} \\right) $$\n    Since both gears are steel, $E_p = E_g = 30 \\times 10^6$ psi.\n    $$ K = \\frac{(49,600)^2 \\sin(20^\\circ)}{1.4} \\left( \\frac{2}{30 \\times 10^6} \\right) = 40.1 \\text{ psi} $$\n*   **Ratio Factor ($Q$)**:\n    $$ Q = \\frac{2N_g}{N_p + N_g} = \\frac{2 \\times 30}{17 + 30} = 1.276 $$\n*   **Allowable Tangential Load (Wear)**: Now we find the maximum load to prevent surface wear. The limit load is first calculated and then divided by the design factor.\n    $$ W_{\\text{limit, wear}} = d_p F Q K = 1.417 \\times 0.875 \\times 1.276 \\times 40.1 = 63.5 \\text{ lb} $$\n    $$ W_{t, \\text{wear}} = \\frac{W_{\\text{limit, wear}}}{N_d} = \\frac{63.5 \\text{ lb}}{2.25} = 28.2 \\text{ lb} $$\n\n### 4. Determine Limiting Load and Power Rating\n\nWe compare the allowable load from bending and wear and choose the smaller value.\n\n*   $W_{t, \\text{bending}} = 293$ lb\n*   $W_{t, \\text{wear}} = 28.2$ lb\n\nThe gearset's capacity is limited by its **wear strength**. The maximum allowable tangential load is:\n$$ W_t = 28.2 \\text{ lb} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the power rating using this limiting load.\n\n*   **Power Rating ($H$)**:\n    $$ H = \\frac{W_t V_t}{33,000} $$\n    $$ H = \\frac{28.2 \\text{ lb} \\times 194.7 \\text{ ft/min}}{33,000} = 0.166 \\text{ HP} $$\n\nThe power rating of the gearset is approximately **0.17 HP**. The very low power rating is due to the material's low hardness (149 BHN), which makes it very susceptible to surface wear."

Given Data & Material Properties**\n\n*   **Gear B:**\n    *   Pitch Diameter, $D_B = 900$ mm\n    *   Tangential Force, $F_{tB} = 4421$ N\n    *   Radial Force, $F_{rB} = 1609$ N\n*   **Gear C:**\n    *   Pitch Diameter, $D_C = 600$ mm\n    *   Tangential Force, $F_{tC} = 6631.5$ N\n    *   Radial Force, $F_{rC} = 2413.02$ N\n*   **Factors:**\n    *   Bending Factor, $k_b = 2.1$\n    *   Torsional Factor, $k_t = 2.4$\n    *   Design Factor (Safety Factor), $N = 2.5$\n*   **Material (AISI 1040 Steel):**\n    *   Yield Strength, $S_y = 420$ MPa (or N/mm\u00b2)\n\n### **2. Force Analysis (Calculating Bending Moment)**\n\nWe will analyze the forces in two separate planes (vertical and horizontal) to find the maximum bending moment.\n\n**a) Vertical Plane (using Tangential Forces)**\n\nThe tangential forces act downwards. We find the support reactions at A and D.\n*   Sum of moments about A = 0:\n    $R_{DV} \\times (200+300) - (4421 \\times 200) - (6631.5 \\times (500+150)) = 0$\n    $R_{DV} \\times 500 = 884200 + 4310475 = 5194675$\n    $R_{DV} = 10389.4$ N (upwards)\n*   Sum of vertical forces = 0:\n    $R_{AV} + 10389.4 - 4421 - 6631.5 = 0$\n    $R_{AV} = 663.1$ N (upwards)\n*   Bending moments in the vertical plane:\n    *   Moment at B: $M_{BV} = 663.1 \\times 200 = 132,620$ N-mm\n    *   Moment at D: $M_{DV} = -6631.5 \\times 150 = -994,725$ N-mm\n\n**b) Horizontal Plane (using Radial Forces)**\n\nThe radial forces act horizontally. We find the support reactions at A and D.\n*   Sum of moments about A = 0:\n    $R_{DH} \\times 500 - (1609 \\times 200) - (2413.02 \\times 650) = 0$\n    $R_{DH} \\times 500 = 321800 + 1568463 = 1890263$\n    $R_{DH} = 3780.5$ N\n*   Sum of horizontal forces = 0:\n    $R_{AH} + 3780.5 - 1609 - 2413.02 = 0$\n    $R_{AH} = 241.5$ N\n*   Bending moments in the horizontal plane:\n    *   Moment at B: $M_{BH} = 241.5 \\times 200 = 48,300$ N-mm\n    *   Moment at D: $M_{DH} = -2413.02 \\times 150 = -361,953$ N-mm\n\n**c) Resultant Bending Moment (M)**\n\nThe total bending moment at any point is the vector sum of the moments from both planes. The critical points are B and D.\n*   Resultant moment at B:\n    $M_B = \\sqrt{(132,620)^2 + (48,300)^2} = 141,150$ N-mm\n*   Resultant moment at D:\n    $M_D = \\sqrt{(-994,725)^2 + (-361,953)^2} = 1,058,628$ N-mm\n\nThe maximum bending moment occurs at bearing D. We will use this value for our design.\n$M_{max} = 1,058,628$ N-mm\n\n### **3. Calculating Torque (T)**\n\nThe torque is transmitted from one gear to the other. We can calculate it using the tangential force and radius of either gear.\n$T = F_{tC} \\times \\frac{D_C}{2} = 6631.5 \\text{ N} \\times \\frac{600 \\text{ mm}}{2}$\n$T = 1,989,450$ N-mm\n\n### **4. Determining Shaft Diameter (d)**\n\nFor a conservative design under fatigue loading, we use the ASME shaft design equation, which is based on the Maximum Shear Stress Theory.\n\nThe equation for a solid circular shaft is:\n$$d^3 = \\frac{16}{\\pi \\tau_{design}} \\sqrt{(k_b M)^2 + (k_t T)^2}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the design shear stress ($\\tau_{design}$), including the factor of safety.\n$$\\tau_{design} = \\frac{S_{sy}}{N} = \\frac{0.5 \\times S_y}{N}$$\n$$\\tau_{design} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 420 \\text{ N/mm}^2}{2.5} = 84 \\text{ N/mm}^2$$\n\nNow, we can plug all the values into the diameter equation:\n*   $M = 1,058,628$ N-mm\n*   $T = 1,989,450$ N-mm\n*   $k_b = 2.1$\n*   $k_t = 2.4$\n*   $\\tau_{design} = 84$ N/mm\u00b2\n\nCalculate the terms inside the square root:\n*   $k_b M = 2.1 \\times 1,058,628 = 2,223,119$ N-mm\n*   $k_t T = 2.4 \\times 1,989,450 = 4,774,680$ N-mm\n\nNow substitute these into the main equation:\n$$d^3 = \\frac{16}{\\pi \\times 84} \\sqrt{(2,223,119)^2 + (4,774,680)^2}$$\n$$d^3 = 0.0606 \\times \\sqrt{4.94 \\times 10^{12} + 22.80 \\times 10^{12}}$$\n$$d^3 = 0.0606 \\times \\sqrt{27.74 \\times 10^{12}}$$\n$$d^3 = 0.0606 \\times 5,266,863$$\n$$d^3 = 319,162 \\text{ mm}^3$$\n\nFinally, take the cube root to find the diameter:\n$$d = (319,162)^{1/3}$$\n$$d = 68.34 \\text{ mm}$$\n\nA safe and practical shaft diameter would be **70 mm**."

List Given Information & Find Basic Parameters\n\nFirst, let's write down what we know and calculate the required speed ratio.\n\n*   **Motor Power (P):** 37 kW\n*   **Motor Speed ($N_1$):** 875 rpm\n*   **Compressor Speed ($N_2$):** 170 rpm\n*   **Compressor Flywheel Diameter ($D_2$):** 1.5 m = 1500 mm\n\n**Speed Ratio (i):**\nThe ratio of the speeds of the motor pulley to the compressor pulley.\n$$\ni = \\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \\frac{875}{170} \\approx 5.15\n$$\n\n**Motor Pulley Diameter ($D_1$):**\nWe can find the diameter of the smaller motor pulley using the speed ratio.\n$$\nD_1 = \\frac{D_2}{i} = \\frac{1500 \\text{ mm}}{5.15} \\approx 291.2 \\text{ mm}\n$$\nWe'll select the nearest standard pulley size, which is **$D_1 = 300$ mm**.\n\n### 2. Select the V-Belt Type\n\nTo choose the right belt, we first need to find the \"Design Power,\" which accounts for the type of machine and daily run time.\n\n**Design Power ($P_d$):**\n$$\nP_d = \\text{Motor Power} \\times \\text{Service Factor } (K_s)\n$$\nFor a compressor running 10-16 hours a day, a typical service factor from standard design tables is $K_s = 1.4$.\n$$\nP_d = 37 \\text{ kW} \\times 1.4 = 51.8 \\text{ kW}\n$$\nBased on a Design Power of 51.8 kW and a motor speed of 875 rpm, standard selection charts recommend a **'C' section V-belt**.\n\n### 3. Determine Belt Length and Center Distance\n\nWe need to decide the distance between the motor and compressor shafts.\n\n**Center Distance (C):**\nA good starting estimate for the center distance is slightly more than the large pulley's diameter. Let's try:\n$$\nC \\approx 1600 \\text{ mm}\n$$\n\n**Belt Pitch Length (L):**\nNow, we calculate the required length of the belt.\n$$\nL = 2C + \\frac{\\pi}{2}(D_2 + D_1) + \\frac{(D_2 - D_1)^2}{4C}\n$$\n$$\nL = 2(1600) + \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1500 + 300) + \\frac{(1500 - 300)^2}{4(1600)}\n$$\n$$\nL = 3200 + 2827 + 225 = 6252 \\text{ mm}\n$$\nFrom standard V-belt tables, the nearest standard length for a C-section belt is **6182 mm (designated as C240)**.\n\n**Final Center Distance:**\nWe adjust our initial center distance to fit this standard belt length. The final corrected center distance will be approximately **$C = 1565$ mm**.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Number of Belts\n\nNext, we find out how much power a single C-section belt can handle in this setup.\n\n**Belt Speed (v):**\n$$\nv = \\frac{\\pi D_1 N_1}{60 \\times 1000} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 300 \\times 875}{60 \\times 1000} = 13.74 \\text{ m/s}\n$$\n\n**Power Rating per Belt:**\nThe power a single belt can transmit depends on its size, speed, length, and how much it wraps around the smaller pulley (arc of contact).\n\n1.  **Basic Power Rating:** From standard tables, a C-section belt at this speed and pulley diameter can handle about **8.5 kW**.\n2.  **Correction Factors:**\n    *   **Length Factor ($K_L$):** For a C240 belt, this factor is **1.12**.\n    *   **Arc of Contact Factor ($K_c$):** The belt wraps around the small pulley by an angle of $\\alpha = 134^\\circ$. For this angle, the factor is **0.88**.\n\n**Corrected Power per Belt:**\n$$\n\\text{Power per Belt} = 8.5 \\text{ kW} \\times 1.12 \\times 0.88 \\approx 8.38 \\text{ kW}\n$$\n\n**Number of Belts (n):**\nFinally, we divide the total Design Power by the power each belt can handle.\n$$\nn = \\frac{\\text{Design Power}}{\\text{Power per Belt}} = \\frac{51.8 \\text{ kW}}{8.38 \\text{ kW}} \\approx 6.18\n$$\nSince we can't have a fraction of a belt, we round up to the next whole number.\n**Number of Belts = 7**\n\n---\n\n### Final Design Summary\n\n*   **Belt Type:** C-Section V-Belt\n*   **Number of Belts:** 7\n*   **Motor Pulley Diameter ($D_1$):** 300 mm\n*   **Compressor Pulley Diameter ($D_2$):** 1500 mm\n*   **Belt Designation:** C240 (Pitch Length = 6182 mm)\n*   **Center Distance (C):** 1565 mm"

Maximum Actuating Force (F)\n\nThe actuating force is determined by taking the sum of moments about the hinge pin for the **leading shoe**, as this is where the maximum pressure occurs. A leading shoe is \"self-energizing,\" meaning the friction helps the actuating force.\n\nThe equilibrium equation for moments about the pivot is:\n$M_{actuating} = M_{Normal} - M_{Friction}$\n\n**a. Calculate the Moment from Normal Forces ($M_N$)**\nThe formula for the moment due to normal forces is:\n$$ M_N = P_{max} \\cdot R \\cdot w \\cdot a \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\sin^2(\\theta) d\\theta $$\nSolving the integral gives:\n$$ M_N = P_{max} \\cdot R \\cdot w \\cdot a \\left[ \\frac{\\theta}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{4} \\right]_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} $$\nPlugging in the values (angles must be in radians for the $\\theta/2$ term):\n$M_N = (1)(200)(75)(150) \\left[ \\left( \\frac{2.88}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(330^\\circ)}{4} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{0.175}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(20^\\circ)}{4} \\right) \\right]$\n$M_N = 2.25 \\times 10^6 \\left[ (1.44 - (-0.125)) - (0.0875 - 0.0855) \\right]$\n$M_N = 2.25 \\times 10^6 [1.565 - 0.002] = 3,516,750 \\text{ N-mm}$\n\n**b.

Brake Capacity (Total Braking Torque)\n\nThe total braking torque is the sum of the torques from all four shoes. A pair of shoes consists of one leading and one trailing shoe.\n\n**a. Torque from one Leading Shoe ($T_{lead}$)**\nThe braking torque is the frictional force multiplied by the drum radius, R.\n$$ T_{lead} = f \\cdot P_{max} \\cdot R^2 \\cdot w \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta = f \\cdot P_{max} \\cdot R^2 \\cdot w [-\\cos(\\theta)]_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} $$\n$T_{lead} = (0.24)(1)(200^2)(75) [-\\cos(165^\\circ) - (-\\cos(10^\\circ))]$\n$T_{lead} = 720,000 [0.966 + 0.985] = 1,404,720 \\text{ N-mm}$\n\n**b. Torque from one Trailing Shoe ($T_{trail}$)**\nFor a trailing shoe, friction opposes the actuation ($F \\cdot d = M_N + M_f$). With the same actuating force F, the pressure on the trailing shoe will be lower. The torque is proportional to this lower pressure.\nThe ratio of the moments determines the pressure reduction:\n$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{M_N - M_f}{M_N + M_f} = \\frac{2,122,182}{3,516,750 + 1,394,568} = \\frac{2,122,182}{4,911,318} = 0.432$\n$T_{trail} = T_{lead} \\times \\text{Ratio} = 1,404,720 \\times 0.432 = 606,839 \\text{ N-mm}$\n\n**c. Total Brake Capacity ($T_{total}$)**\nThe brake has four shoes, which form two pairs of (leading + trailing) shoes.\n$T_{total} = 2 \\times (T_{lead} + T_{trail})$\n$T_{total} = 2 \\times (1,404,720 + 606,839) = 2 \\times 2,011,559 = 4,023,118 \\text{ N-mm}$\n\n**Brake Capacity \u2248 4023 N-m**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Hinge-Pin Reaction\n\nWe will calculate the reaction on the hinge pin for the **leading shoe**, as it carries the highest load. The reaction force has horizontal ($R_x$) and vertical ($R_y$) components.\n\n**a. Calculate Total Forces from Drum on Shoe**\nFirst, we find the total horizontal and vertical components of the normal and frictional forces acting on the shoe.\n*   Total Normal Force (x-comp): $F_{Nx} = 276 \\text{ N}$\n*   Total Normal Force (y-comp): $F_{Ny} = 23,445 \\text{ N}$\n*   Total Frictional Force (x-comp): $F_{fx} = 5,627 \\text{ N}$\n*   Total Frictional Force (y-comp): $F_{fy} = 66 \\text{ N}$\n\n**b. Apply Force Equilibrium**\nFor a leading shoe on the right side with clockwise rotation, the sum of forces in the x and y directions must be zero. The reaction components ($R_x, R_y$) balance the actuating force (F) and the forces from the drum.\n$\\sum F_x = R_x + F - F_{Nx} + F_{fx} = 0$  (Signs depend on coordinate system and force directions)\nA detailed force balance yields:\n$R_x = -F_{actuating} - F_{drum\\_x} = -42,444 - (-5903) = -36,541 \\text{ N}$\n$R_y = -F_{drum\\_y} = -(-23,379) = 23,379 \\text{ N}$\n\n**c. Calculate Resultant Hinge-Pin Reaction (R)**\nThe total reaction is the magnitude of the vector sum of the components.\n$$ R = \\sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2} $$\n$R = \\sqrt{(-36,541)^2 + (23,379)^2} = \\sqrt{1.335 \\times 10^9 + 0.547 \\times 10^9} = 43,385 \\text{ N}$\n\n**Hinge-Pin Reaction (on leading shoe) \u2248 43.4 kN**"

Let's choose:\n*   **Teeth on small sprocket (T\u2081): 21**\n\nNow, we calculate the teeth for the large sprocket (`T\u2082`).\n\n$$\nT\u2082 = i \\times T\u2081 = 5 \\times 21 = 105 \\text{ teeth}\n$$\nThis is a reasonable number (typically under 120 teeth is preferred).\n\n### 3. Determine the Design Power\n\nThe operating conditions (moderate shock, long hours, dirty environment) require us to use a higher \"Design Power\" than the motor's actual power. We do this using a **Service Factor (K\u209b)**.\n\n*   **Load Factor (K\u2081):** For moderate shock loads, this is typically **1.4**.\n*   **Other Factors (K\u2082):** For multi-shift duty and poor conditions, we add another factor. Let's combine them into a single service factor.\n\nBased on standard design tables for a motor driving a reciprocating pump under these conditions, a conservative **Service Factor (K\u209b) of 1.5** is appropriate.\n\nNow, calculate the Design Power (`P_d`):\n\n$$\nP_d = \\text{Power (P)} \\times \\text{Service Factor (K\u209b)}\n$$\n\n$$\nP_d = 24 \\text{ hp} \\times 1.5 = 36 \\text{ hp}\n$$\nWe must select a chain that can handle at least **36 hp** at the motor's speed of **800 rev/min**.\n\n### 4. Select the Roller Chain\n\nWe use a power-rating chart from a design handbook to find a suitable chain. We look for a chain that can handle **36 hp** at **800 rev/min**.\n\n*   **RC 60 (Pitch = 0.75\"):** Rated for about 15 hp. (Too low)\n*   **RC 80 (Pitch = 1.0\"):** Rated for about 28 hp. (Too low)\n*   **RC 100 (Pitch = 1.25\"):** Rated for about 45 hp. (Looks good)\n\nA single-strand **RC 100** chain can handle the design power. This choice aligns with the \"liberal approach\" requested.\n\n### 5. Determine Chain Length and Center Distance\n\nA good rule of thumb for the center distance (`C`) between sprockets is 30 to 50 times the chain pitch.\n*   **Chain Pitch (p) for RC 100:** 1.25 inches\n\nLet's choose a center distance in this range:\n*   `C \u2248 40 \u00d7 p = 40 \u00d7 1.25 = 50` inches.\n\nNow, we calculate the required chain length (`L`) in pitches.\n\n$$\nL_p = 2\\left(\\frac{C}{p}\\right) + \\frac{T\u2081 + T\u2082}{2} + \\frac{\\left(T\u2082 - T\u2081\\right)^2}{4\\pi^2\\left(\\frac{C}{p}\\right)}\n$$\n\n$$\nL_p = 2(40) + \\frac{21 + 105}{2} + \\frac{(105 - 21)^2}{4\\pi^2(40)} \\approx 80 + 63 + 4.5 = 147.5 \\text{ pitches}\n$$\n\nChain length must be an even whole number. So, we round up to **148 pitches**.\n\n*   **Final Chain Length:** `148 pitches \u00d7 1.25 in/pitch = 185` inches.\n\n### 6. Final Sprocket Dimensions\n\nWe need the pitch diameter of each sprocket for manufacturing.\n\n**Small Sprocket (Driver):**\n*   **Teeth (T\u2081):** 21\n*   **Pitch Diameter (D\u2081):**\n\n$$\nD\u2081 = \\frac{p}{\\sin(180\u00b0/T\u2081)} = \\frac{1.25\"}{\\sin(180\u00b0/21)} \\approx 8.38 \\text{ inches}\n$$\n\n**Large Sprocket (Driven):**\n*   **Teeth (T\u2082):** 105\n*   **Pitch Diameter (D\u2082):**\n\n$$\nD\u2082 = \\frac{p}{\\sin(180\u00b0/T\u2082)} = \\frac{1.25\"}{\\sin(180\u00b0/105)} \\approx 41.90 \\text{ inches}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Design Summary\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Selected Chain** | **RC 100 (1.25\" pitch)** |\n| **Small Sprocket (T\u2081)** | **21 teeth** (Pitch Diameter \u2248 8.38 in) |\n| **Large Sprocket (T\u2082)** | **105 teeth** (Pitch Diameter \u2248 41.90 in) |\n| **Center Distance (C)** | Approx. **50 inches** |\n| **Chain Length (L)** | **148 pitches** (185 inches) |"

It relates all the key variables of a bearing\u2014viscosity, speed, load, and geometry\u2014into a single parameter.\n\nThe formula for the Sommerfeld Number is:\n\n$$\nS = \\left(\\frac{r}{c}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\mu N}{P}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n*   **S** = Sommerfeld Number (dimensionless)\n*   **\u03bc** = Absolute viscosity of the lubricant\n*   **N** = Speed of the journal in revolutions per second (rps)\n*   **P** = Bearing pressure on the projected area (Load / Ld)\n*   **r** = Radius of the journal\n*   **c** = Radial clearance (the small gap between the journal and the bearing)\n\n---\n\n### Significance of the Sommerfeld Number\n\nThe Sommerfeld number is crucial because it acts as a performance index for the journal bearing. Its primary significance is:\n\n1.  **Predicting Bearing Performance:** The calculated value of 'S' is used with standard bearing performance charts (like the McKee charts or Raimondi-Boyd charts). Using these charts, a designer can determine all other important operating characteristics of the bearing, such as:\n    *   Coefficient of friction.\n    *   Minimum oil film thickness (to check for metal-to-metal contact).\n    *   Oil flow rate required for lubrication and cooling.\n    *   The position where the oil film is thinnest.\n\n2.  **Design Optimization:** It allows engineers to assess the quality of a bearing's design. If the Sommerfeld number is too low, the oil film may be too thin, risking seizure or wear. If it is too high, the power lost to friction might be excessive. Designers can adjust variables like lubricant viscosity or clearance (`c`) to achieve an optimal Sommerfeld number for stable and efficient operation.\n\nIn short, the Sommerfeld number simplifies the complex problem of bearing design by combining multiple variables into one number that directly links to the bearing's overall performance."

Determine Bearing Geometry for Minimum Clearance\n\nThe problem asks for the \"minimum clearance assembly\". This occurs when the shaft is at its largest possible size and the bushing bore is at its smallest possible size.\n\n*   **Maximum Shaft Diameter (`d`):**\n    `d = 56.000 mm` (since the tolerance is -0.012 mm, the max size has 0 tolerance)\n\n*   **Minimum Bore Diameter (`D`):**\n    `D = 56.050 mm` (since the tolerance is +0.012 mm, the min size has 0 tolerance)\n\n*   **Diametral Clearance (`c_d`):**\n    `c_d = D - d = 56.050 - 56.000 = 0.050 mm`\n\n*   **Radial Clearance (`c`):** The radial clearance is half of the diametral clearance.\n    `c = c_d / 2 = 0.050 / 2 = 0.025 mm`\n\n*   **Bearing Radius (`r`):**\n    `r = d / 2 = 56 / 2 = 28 mm`\n\n*   **L/D Ratio:**\n    `L/D = 28 / 56 = 0.5`\n\n### 3.

For this solution, we will assume the following reasonable dimensions:\n*   Bearing O is at the origin (`x=0`).\n*   Gear 3 is at `x = 6` inches.\n*   Gear 4 is at `x = 14` inches.\n*   Bearing C is at `x = 20` inches.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Forces on the Gears\n\nFirst, we need to find the tangential and radial forces exerted by each gear on the shaft.\n\n**For Gear 3:**\nThe total force `F\u2083` is 240 lbf at a 20\u00b0 pressure angle.\n*   Tangential Force (`W_t3`):\n    $W_{t3} = F_3 \\cos(20^\\circ) = 240 \\times 0.940 = 225.6 \\text{ lbf}$\n*   Radial Force (`W_r3`):\n    $W_{r3} = F_3 \\sin(20^\\circ) = 240 \\times 0.342 = 82.1 \\text{ lbf}$\n\n**For Gear 4:**\nThe torque on the shaft is constant.

We'll do this in two planes: vertical (z-direction) and horizontal (y-direction).\n\n**Vertical Plane (Tangential Forces):**\n*   Forces: `W_t3 = 225.6 lbf` (down) at x=6, `W_t4 = 451.2 lbf` (up) at x=14.\n*   Sum of moments about O to find `R_Cz`:\n    $\\sum M_O = 0 \\implies (R_{Cz} \\times 20) - (225.6 \\times 6) + (451.2 \\times 14) = 0$\n    $20 R_{Cz} - 1353.6 + 6316.8 = 0 \\implies R_{Cz} = -248.2 \\text{ lbf}$ (downward)\n*   Sum of forces to find `R_Oz`:\n    $\\sum F_z = 0 \\implies R_{Oz} + R_{Cz} - 225.6 + 451.2 = 0$\n    $R_{Oz} - 248.2 - 225.6 + 451.2 = 0 \\implies R_{Oz} = 22.6 \\text{ lbf}$ (upward)\n\n**Horizontal Plane (Radial Forces):**\n*   Forces: `W_r3 = 82.1 lbf` (in +y) at x=6, `W_r4 = 210.2 lbf` (in -y) at x=14.\n*   Sum of moments about O to find `R_Cy`:\n    $\\sum M_O = 0 \\implies (R_{Cy} \\times 20) + (82.1 \\times 6) - (210.2 \\times 14) = 0$\n    $20 R_{Cy} + 492.6 - 2942.8 = 0 \\implies R_{Cy} = 122.5 \\text{ lbf}$\n*   Sum of forces to find `R_Oy`:\n    $\\sum F_y = 0 \\implies R_{Oy} + R_{Cy} + 82.1 - 210.2 = 0$\n    $R_{Oy} + 122.5 + 82.1 - 210.2 = 0 \\implies R_{Oy} = 5.6 \\text{ lbf}$\n\n**Total Radial Load on each Bearing:**\n*   Bearing O:\n    $R_O = \\sqrt{R_{Oz}^2 + R_{Oy}^2} = \\sqrt{(22.6)^2 + (5.6)^2} = \\mathbf{23.3 \\text{ lbf}}$\n*   Bearing C:\n    $R_C = \\sqrt{R_{Cz}^2 + R_{Cy}^2} = \\sqrt{(-248.2)^2 + (122.5)^2} = \\mathbf{276.7 \\text{ lbf}}$\n\nBearing C carries a significantly higher load, so it will be the basis for our selection.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Required Bearing Life and Load Rating\n\nWe need to find the basic dynamic load rating, `C\u2081\u2080`, which is the load a bearing can carry for one million revolutions.\n\n**1. Desired Life in Revolutions (`L_d`)**\n$L_d = (\\text{Life in hours}) \\times (\\text{speed in rpm}) \\times (60 \\text{ min/hr})$\n$L_d = 50,000 \\times 300 \\times 60 = 900 \\times 10^6 \\text{ revolutions}$\n\n**2. Adjust for Reliability**\nThe standard `C\u2081\u2080` rating is for 90% reliability. We need 96% reliability for the pair, which means each bearing must have a reliability of `sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98` or 98%.\n\nTo achieve higher reliability, the bearing needs a higher `L\u2081\u2080` rating. We use a life-adjustment factor, `a\u2081`, from tables. For 98% reliability, `a\u2081 \u2248 0.33`.\nThe required catalog life (`L\u2081\u2080,req`) is:\n$L_{10, req} = \\frac{L_d}{a_1} = \\frac{900 \\times 10^6}{0.33} = 2727 \\times 10^6 \\text{ revolutions}$\n\n**3.

For example:\n*   An **SKF 7206 B** series bearing has a `C\u2081\u2080` of **20.8 kN**.\n*   An **SKF 7305 B** series bearing has a `C\u2081\u2080` of **23.2 kN**.\n\nBoth would be acceptable choices. Let's select the **7305 B** as it provides a safety margin. The 'B' indicates a 40\u00b0 contact angle, suitable for handling thrust loads, which are inherent in angular contact bearings.\n\n**Final Selection:**\nSelect two **7305 B Series Angular Contact Ball Bearings**, one for location O and one for location C. These bearings would require a shaft diameter of 25 mm at the bearing seats."

Geometric Properties and Velocity\n\nFirst, we find the pinion's pitch diameter and its pitch line velocity.\n\n*   **Pitch Diameter ($d_p$)**:\n    $$\n    d_p = \\frac{N_p}{P_d} = \\frac{30}{6} = 5 \\text{ in}\n    $$\n*   **Pitch Line Velocity ($V$)**:\n    $$\n    V = \\frac{\\pi d_p n_p}{12} = \\frac{\\pi (5 \\text{ in})(900 \\text{ rev/min})}{12 \\text{ in/ft}} = 1178 \\text{ ft/min}\n    $$\n\n### 2. Allowable Bending Stress ($\\sigma_{all}$)\n\nNext, we calculate the allowable stress for the cast iron material.\n\n*   **AGMA Allowable Bending Stress ($S_t$)**: For No. 30 cast iron, the standard value is $S_t = 13,000$ psi.\n*   The problem provides the following factors:\n    *   Life Factor, $K_L = 1$\n    *   Temperature Factor, $K_T = 1$\n    *   Reliability Factor, $K_R = 1$\n    *   Bending Safety Factor, $S_F = 2$\n*   **Calculation**:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{all} = \\frac{S_t K_L}{S_F K_T K_R} = \\frac{(13,000 \\text{ psi})(1)}{(2)(1)(1)} = 6,500 \\text{ psi}\n    $$\n\n### 3. AGMA Modification Factors\n\nWe need to determine several factors that adjust the calculation for real-world conditions.\n\n*   **Geometry Factor ($J$)**: This factor depends on the number of teeth. From AGMA charts for a 30-tooth pinion and a 60-tooth gear, the pinion's geometry factor is approximately:\n    $$\n    J \\approx 0.21\n    $$\n    *(We use the pinion's J-factor because it is typically weaker than the gear.)*\n\n*   **Dynamic Factor ($K_v$)**: This accounts for inaccuracies in the gear teeth. Using the transmission accuracy number ($A_v=6$) and velocity ($V=1178$ ft/min):\n    $$\n    K_v \\approx 0.69\n    $$\n    *(This is calculated from standard AGMA formulas for a quality number of 6.)*\n\n*   **Overload Factor ($K_o$)**: This depends on the power source and the driven machine. Since this information is not given, we will assume a uniform power source and uniform load.\n    $$\n    K_o = 1.0\n    $$\n\n*   **Load Distribution Factor ($K_m$)**: This accounts for how the load is distributed across the face of the gear tooth. The problem states the pinion is mounted \"outboard\" (overhung) and the gear is \"straddled\". For this type of mounting and a face width of 1.25 in, a typical value from AGMA charts is:\n    $$\n    K_m \\approx 1.4\n    $$\n\n*   **Size Factor ($K_s$)**: For gears of this size, the size factor is typically taken as 1.\n    $$\n    K_s = 1.0\n    $$\n\n### 4. Allowable Tangential Load ($W_t$)\n\nNow we can combine these factors to find the maximum tangential load the gear can handle.\n\nThe AGMA bending strength equation is:\n$$\n\\sigma = W_t \\frac{P_d}{F} \\frac{K_o K_m K_v}{J K_s}\n$$\nSetting the stress $\\sigma$ to the allowable stress $\\sigma_{all}$ and solving for $W_t$:\n$$\nW_t = \\frac{\\sigma_{all} F J K_s}{P_d K_o K_m K_v}\n$$\nPlugging in our values:\n$$\nW_t = \\frac{(6500)(1.25)(0.21)(1.0)}{(6)(1.0)(1.4)(0.69)} = \\frac{1706.25}{5.796} \\approx 294.4 \\text{ lbf}\n$$\n\n### 5.

                                    "solution": "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Find Bearing Properties from Catalog\n\nFirst, we identify the bearing based on its type and bore size.\n*   **Type:** 02-series single-row deep-groove ball bearing\n*   **Bore:** 65 mm\n\nLooking this up in a standard bearing catalog, this corresponds to a **6213** bearing. The key properties for this bearing are:\n*   **Basic Dynamic Load Rating ($C_{10}$):** 71.5 kN\n*   **Basic Static Load Rating ($C_0$):** 54.0 kN\n\n### 2. Calculate the Equivalent Dynamic Load ($P_e$)\n\nSince the bearing has both radial and axial loads, we must calculate a single equivalent load ($P_e$) that represents the combined effect.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$\nP_e = X V F_r + Y F_a\n$$\nWhere:\n*   $F_r$ = Radial Load = 7 kN\n*   $F_a$ = Axial Load = 3 kN\n*   $V$ = Rotation factor. Since the inner ring rotates (typical), $V=1$.\n*   $X$ and $Y$ are factors found from a bearing data table.\n\nTo find $X$ and $Y$, we first calculate the ratio $\\frac{F_a}{C_0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{F_a}{C_0} = \\frac{3 \\text{ kN}}{54 \\text{ kN}} = 0.0556\n$$\nUsing this value and a standard table for deep-groove ball bearings, we find the parameter $e \\approx 0.26$.\n\nNow, we check if $\\frac{F_a}{F_r}$ is greater or less than $e$:\n$$\n\\frac{F_a}{F_r} = \\frac{3 \\text{ kN}}{7 \\text{ kN}} = 0.429\n$$\nSince $0.429 > e$ (0.26), we use the following factors from the table:\n*   $X = 0.56$\n*   $Y \\approx 1.63$ (by interpolation for $\\frac{F_a}{C_0} = 0.0556$)\n\nNow, we can calculate the equivalent load $P_e$:\n$$\nP_e = (0.56)(1)(7 \\text{ kN}) + (1.63)(3 \\text{ kN}) = 3.92 + 4.89 = 8.81 \\text{ kN}\n$$\n\n### 3. Determine the Required Rating Life ($L_{10}$)\n\nWe need to find the life the bearing must have to meet the requirements.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate desired life in revolutions ($L_D$)**\n    The bearing must last for 10,000 hours at 500 rev/min.\n    $$\n    L_D = (\\text{Life in hours}) \\times (\\text{Speed in rpm}) \\times (60 \\text{ min/hr})\n    $$\n    $$\n    L_D = (10,000) \\times (500) \\times (60) = 300 \\times 10^6 \\text{ revolutions}\n    $$\n\n*   **Step 3b: Adjust for 95% Reliability**\n    Catalog ratings ($C_{10}$) are based on 90% reliability. We need 95%. We use a reliability factor ($K_R$) to adjust the required life. For 95% reliability, $K_R = 0.62$.\n\n    The required rating life ($L_{10}$) is:\n    $$\n    L_{10, \\text{req}} = \\frac{L_D}{K_R} = \\frac{300 \\times 10^6}{0.62} = 483.87 \\times 10^6 \\text{ revolutions}\n    $$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Required Dynamic Load Rating ($C_{10, \\text{req}}$)\n\nNow we can calculate the dynamic load rating the bearing *must have* to satisfy the life and load conditions. We also include an **Application Factor ($K_a$)** to account for minor shocks from a ceiling fan. A typical value for fans is $K_a = 1.2$.\n\nThe life-load equation is:\n$$\nC_{10, \\text{req}} = K_a P_e \\left( \\frac{L_{10, \\text{req}}}{L_R} \\right)^{1/a}\n$$\nWhere:\n*   $L_R$ = Rating life = $10^6$ revolutions (for ball bearings)\n*   $a$ = 3 (for ball bearings)\n\nPlugging in our values:\n$$\nC_{10, \\text{req}} = (1.2)(8.81 \\text{ kN}) \\left( \\frac{483.87 \\times 10^6}{10^6} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n$$\nC_{10, \\text{req}} = 10.57 \\text{ kN} \\times (483.87)^{1/3}\n$$\n$$\nC_{10, \\text{req}} = 10.57 \\times 7.85 = 83.0 \\text{ kN}\n$$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nFinally, we compare the required rating with the bearing's actual catalog rating.\n\n*   **Required Rating ($C_{10, \\text{req}}$):** 83.0 kN\n*   **Catalog Rating ($C_{10}$):** 71.5 kN\n\nSince the required dynamic load rating (83.0 kN) is **greater than** the catalog rating of the 6213 bearing (71.5 kN), the bearing is **not suitable** for this application. It is not expected to carry this load with 95% reliability for 10,000 hours."

Calculate the Sommerfeld Number (S)**\n\nThe Sommerfeld number is a dimensionless value that helps us characterize the bearing's performance. To calculate it, we first need the lubricant's viscosity.\n\n***Assumption:** Since the lubricant type and temperature are not given, we will assume a common choice: **SAE 20 oil at an operating temperature of 160\u00b0F**. From standard charts, the absolute viscosity ($\\mu$) for this is approximately **$2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ reyn** (lbf\u00b7s/in\u00b2).*\n\nNow, we can calculate the Sommerfeld Number, S:\n$$\nS = \\left(\\frac{r}{c}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\mu n}{P}\n$$\n$$\nS = \\left(\\frac{0.625}{0.001}\\right)^2 \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ reyn})(18.67 \\text{ rev/s})}{248 \\text{ psi}}\n$$\n$$\nS = (625)^2 (1.506 \\times 10^{-7}) = \\mathbf{0.0588}\n$$\n\n### **4. Find the Minimum Film Thickness ($h_0$)**\n\nWe use the Sommerfeld number (S = 0.0588) to find the minimum film thickness from bearing performance charts. Since our L/D ratio is 1.6 (a \"long\" bearing), we can use the chart for an infinitely long bearing ($L/D = \\infty$) as a good approximation.\n\nFrom the chart, we find the \"Minimum Film Thickness Variable\" ($h_0/c$):\nFor $S = 0.0588$, the chart gives:\n$$\n\\frac{h_0}{c} \\approx 0.24\n$$\nNow, we can solve for $h_0$:\n$$\nh_0 = 0.24 \\times c = 0.24 \\times 0.001 \\text{ in}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{h_0 = 0.00024 \\text{ in}}\n$$\n\n### **5. Find the Coefficient of Friction (f)**\n\nUsing the same Sommerfeld number (S = 0.0588) and the $L/D = \\infty$ chart, we find the \"Coefficient of Friction Variable\" ($(r/c)f$):\nFor $S = 0.0588$, the chart gives:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{c}f \\approx 2.2\n$$\nNow, we can solve for the coefficient of friction, $f$:\n$$\nf = 2.2 \\times \\frac{c}{r} = 2.2 \\times \\frac{0.001}{0.625}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{f = 0.00352}\n$$\n\n### **Summary of Results**\n\nFor the minimum clearance assembly, the calculated performance characteristics are:\n*   **Minimum Film Thickness ($h_0$):** 0.00024 in\n*   **Coefficient of Friction ($f$):** 0.00352"

Basic Geometric and Kinematic Properties**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the pinion's pitch diameter and the pitch-line velocity.\n\n*   **Pitch Diameter of Pinion ($d_P$)**\n    The pitch diameter is the module times the number of teeth.\n    $d_P = \\text{module} \\times N_P = 6 \\text{ mm} \\times 16 = 96 \\text{ mm} = 0.096 \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Pitch-Line Velocity ($V$)**\n    This is the speed of the gear teeth at the pitch circle.\n\n    $$\n    V = \\frac{\\pi d_P n_P}{60}\n    $$\n\n    $V = \\frac{\\pi \\times 0.096 \\text{ m} \\times 1145 \\text{ rev/min}}{60} = 5.75 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n### **2. Bending Strength (Resistance to Tooth Breakage)**\n\nWe need to find the maximum tangential force ($W_t$) the teeth can handle without breaking. We'll check both the pinion and the gear.\n\n*   **Allowable Bending Stress ($\\sigma_{all}$)**\n    This is the maximum stress the material can endure in bending. It's based on the ultimate tensile strength ($S_{ut}$) and the design factor ($N_d$).\n    *   Endurance Limit, $S_e' \\approx 0.5 \\times S_{ut} = 0.5 \\times 900 \\text{ MPa} = 450 \\text{ MPa}$\n    *   Allowable Stress, $\\sigma_{all} = \\frac{S_e'}{N_d} = \\frac{450 \\text{ MPa}}{1.3} = 346 \\text{ MPa}$\n\n*   **Dynamic Factor ($K_v$)**\n    This factor accounts for inaccuracies in milled gear teeth, which cause extra impact forces at higher speeds.\n\n    $$\n    K_v = \\frac{6.1 + V}{6.1}\n    $$\n\n    $K_v = \\frac{6.1 + 5.75}{6.1} = 1.94$\n\n*   **Geometry Factor ($J$)**\n    This factor depends on the tooth shape. We find it from standard tables for $20^\\circ$ full-depth teeth.\n    *   For the Pinion ($N_P = 16$ teeth): $J_P = 0.24$\n    *   For the Gear ($N_G = 30$ teeth): $J_G = 0.32$\n\n*   **Allowable Tangential Load for Bending ($W_{t, \\text{bending}}$)**\n    Now we can calculate the force for both the pinion and the gear using the simplified AGMA bending equation.\n\n    $$\n    W_t = \\frac{\\sigma_{all} \\cdot F \\cdot m \\cdot J}{K_v}\n    $$\n\n    *   **Pinion:**\n        $W_{t, \\text{Pinion}} = \\frac{(346 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}) \\cdot (0.075 \\text{ m}) \\cdot (0.006 \\text{ m}) \\cdot 0.24}{1.94} = 19,217 \\text{ N}$\n\n    *   **Gear:**\n        $W_{t, \\text{Gear}} = \\frac{(346 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}) \\cdot (0.075 \\text{ m}) \\cdot (0.006 \\text{ m}) \\cdot 0.32}{1.94} = 25,623 \\text{ N}$\n\nThe pinion is weaker in bending because it can withstand less force (19,217 N vs 25,623 N).\n\n### **3. Wear Strength (Resistance to Surface Pitting)**\n\nNext, we find the maximum force the tooth surfaces can handle without pitting or wearing out.\n\n*   **Allowable Contact Stress ($\\sigma_{all,c}$)**\n    This is based on the material's surface hardness (HB) and the design factor.\n    *   Surface Endurance Limit, $S_c = (2.76 \\times \\text{HB} - 69) \\text{ MPa} = (2.76 \\times 260 - 69) = 648.6 \\text{ MPa}$\n    *   Allowable Contact Stress, $\\sigma_{all,c} = \\frac{S_c}{N_d} = \\frac{648.6 \\text{ MPa}}{1.3} = 499 \\text{ MPa}$\n\n*   **Geometry Factor ($I$)**\n    This factor accounts for the geometry of the contacting surfaces.\n    *   Gear Ratio, $m_G = N_G / N_P = 30 / 16 = 1.875$\n\n    $$\n    I = \\frac{\\sin\\phi \\cos\\phi}{2} \\frac{m_G}{m_G+1}\n    $$\n\n    $I = \\frac{\\sin(20^\\circ) \\cos(20^\\circ)}{2} \\frac{1.875}{1.875+1} = 0.105$\n\n*   **Elastic Coefficient ($C_p$)**\n    For a steel pinion meshing with a steel gear, this value is a constant.\n    $C_p = 191 \\sqrt{\\text{MPa}}$\n\n*   **Allowable Tangential Load for Wear ($W_{t, \\text{wear}}$)**\n    We use the simplified AGMA wear equation. This calculation applies to the gear set as a whole.\n\n    $$\n    W_t = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{all,c}}{C_p}\\right)^2 \\frac{F \\cdot d_P \\cdot I}{K_v}\n    $$\n\n    $W_t = \\left(\\frac{499}{191}\\right)^2 \\frac{(0.075 \\text{ m}) \\cdot (0.096 \\text{ m}) \\cdot 0.105}{1.94} = 2,653 \\text{ N}$\n\n### **4. Final Power Rating**\n\nTo find the power rating of the gearset, we must use the lowest of the calculated allowable forces.\n\n*   **Compare Allowable Loads:**\n    *   Bending (Pinion): 19,217 N\n    *   Bending (Gear): 25,623 N\n    *   Wear (Gearset): 2,653 N\n\nThe lowest value is **2,653 N**, which means the gearset's performance is limited by its resistance to surface wear.\n\n*   **Calculate Power Rating (P)**\n\n    $$\n    P = W_t \\times V\n    $$\n\n    $P = 2,653 \\text{ N} \\times 5.75 \\text{ m/s} = 15,255 \\text{ W}$\n\nConverting to kilowatts:\n$P = 15.3 \\text{ kW}$\n\nThe power rating of the gearset is **15.3 kW**, limited by wear fatigue."

                                    "solution": "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Find the Normal Force (N)\n\nFirst, we need to find the normal force, which is the force the brake shoe presses onto the drum. We can do this by looking at the forces on the lever and making sure it's in equilibrium (not rotating around the pivot).\n\nWe'll sum the moments about the pivot point. A moment is a turning force, calculated as `Force \u00d7 Distance`. We'll consider counter-clockwise (CCW) moments as positive.\n\nThe forces creating moments on the lever are:\n*   **Actuating Force (F):** `F = 90 lbf`. It's applied at a distance of `8 in + 12 in = 20 in` from the pivot. It creates a clockwise (CW) moment.\n    *   Moment = `-F \u00d7 20 = -90 \u00d7 20 = -1800 lbf\u00b7in`.\n*   **Normal Force (N):** This is the upward force from the drum onto the shoe. It acts at a horizontal distance of `8 in` from the pivot, creating a CCW moment.\n    *   Moment = `+N \u00d7 8`.\n*   **Friction Force (F_f):** Since the drum rotates clockwise, the friction force on the shoe acts to the right. This force is applied at the drum surface, which is `6 in` vertically from the pivot. This creates a CW moment that helps the actuating force (this is called \"self-energizing\").\n    *   The friction force is `F_f = f \u00d7 N = 0.25 \u00d7 N`.\n    *   Moment = `-F_f \u00d7 6 = -(0.25 \u00d7 N) \u00d7 6 = -1.5N`.\n\nNow, we sum the moments and set them to zero for balance:\n$$\n\\sum M_{pivot} = (N \\times 8) - (F \\times 20) - (F_f \\times 6) = 0\n$$\nSubstitute the known values:\n$$\n8N - (90 \\times 20) - (0.25N \\times 6) = 0\n$$\n$$\n8N - 1800 - 1.5N = 0\n$$\n$$\n6.5N = 1800\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{1800}{6.5} \\approx 276.92 \\text{ lbf}\n$$\n\n### 2. Find the Maximum Pressure (p_max)\n\nThe question asks for the *maximum* pressure. Since the brake shoe contacts the drum over a wide angle (90\u00b0), the pressure isn't uniform. It's highest at the center and lower at the edges.\n\n1.  **Calculate Contact Area (A):**\n    The contact area is the face width multiplied by the arc length of the shoe.\n    *   Contact Angle `(2\u03b8)` = 90\u00b0 = `\u03c0/2` radians.\n    *   Radius `(r)` = 6 in.\n    *   Face Width `(b)` = 1.25 in.\n    $$\n    A = b \\times r \\times (2\\theta_{rad}) = 1.25 \\text{ in} \\times 6 \\text{ in} \\times (\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\approx 11.78 \\text{ in}^2\n    $$\n\n2.  **Calculate Average Pressure (p_avg):**\n    $$\n    p_{avg} = \\frac{N}{A} = \\frac{276.92 \\text{ lbf}}{11.78 \\text{ in}^2} \\approx 23.5 \\text{ psi}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Calculate Maximum Pressure (p_max):**\n    For a shoe with a sinusoidal pressure distribution, the maximum pressure is related to the average pressure.\n    *   `\u03b8_max` is half the total angle: `90\u00b0 / 2 = 45\u00b0`.\n    $$\n    p_{max} = p_{avg} \\left( \\frac{\\theta_{max, rad}}{\\sin(\\theta_{max})} \\right)\n    $$\n    We must use `\u03b8_max` in radians for the numerator (`45\u00b0 = \u03c0/4` rad).\n    $$\n    p_{max} = 23.5 \\text{ psi} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/4}{\\sin(45^\\circ)} \\right) = 23.5 \\left( \\frac{0.7854}{0.7071} \\right) \\approx 26.1 \\text{ psi}\n    $$\n    **The maximum pressure is 26.1 psi.**\n\n### 3. Find the Braking Torque (T)\n\nThe braking torque is the friction force multiplied by the drum radius.\n*   Friction Force `F_f = f \u00d7 N = 0.25 \u00d7 276.92 = 69.23 lbf`.\n*   Drum Radius `r = 6 in`.\n\n$$\nT = F_f \\times r\n$$\n$$\nT = (f \\times N) \\times r\n$$\n$$\nT = (0.25 \\times 276.92 \\text{ lbf}) \\times 6 \\text{ in} \\approx 415.4 \\text{ lbf\u00b7in}\n$$\n**The braking torque is 415.4 lbf\u00b7in.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   **Maximum Pressure (`p_max`):** `26.1 psi`\n*   **Braking Torque (`T`):** `415.4 lbf\u00b7in`"

Calculate Belt Speed (V)\n\nFirst, we need to find how fast the belt is moving. We can calculate this using the pulley diameter and its rotational speed.\n\n*   **Pulley Diameter (D):** 48 in = 4 ft\n*   **Pulley Speed (n):** 380 rev/min\n\nThe formula for belt speed is:\n$$ V = \\pi \\times D \\times n $$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$ V = \\pi \\times (4 \\text{ ft}) \\times (380 \\text{ rev/min}) \\approx 4775 \\text{ ft/min} $$\n\n### 2. Determine the Design Power (P_d)\n\nThe application involves \"moderate shock,\" so we need to use a service factor (K_s) to find the design power. The service factor accounts for the extra stress from the shock loads. For moderate shock, a typical service factor is 1.4.\n\n*   **Rated Power (P):** 60 hp\n*   **Service Factor (K_s):** 1.4 (assumed for moderate shock)\n\nThe formula for design power is:\n$$ P_d = P \\times K_s $$\n$$ P_d = 60 \\text{ hp} \\times 1.4 = 84 \\text{ hp} $$\nThis is the power our belt must be designed to handle.\n\n### 3. Select a Belt Type and Find its Capacity\n\nWe need to choose a standard belt material. A modern, high-performance choice is a **Polyamide (A-3) belt**. From standard design tables (like those in Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design), a belt of this type has a base rated capacity.\n\n*   **Assumed Belt Type:** Polyamide A-3\n*   **Manufacturer's Rated Capacity (H\u2080):** 13.0 hp per inch of width\n\nThis rated capacity needs to be adjusted for our specific operating conditions.\n\n### 4. Apply Correction Factors\n\nWe apply correction factors to the base capacity to get the true allowable power for our system.\n\n*   **Angle of Wrap Factor (C_\u03b8):** Since both pulleys are the same size, the belt wraps 180\u00b0 around each one. For a 180\u00b0 wrap, the correction factor is **1.0**.\n*   **Velocity Correction Factor (C_V):** This factor accounts for the effect of centrifugal force, which becomes significant at high speeds. Our speed is 4775 ft/min. From a typical design chart for this belt type and speed, a reasonable correction factor is **0.85**.\n\nNow, we calculate the allowable horsepower per inch of width (`H_a`):\n$$ H_a = H_0 \\times C_{\\theta} \\times C_V $$\n$$ H_a = (13.0 \\text{ hp/in}) \\times 1.0 \\times 0.85 = 11.05 \\text{ hp/in} $$\n\n### 5. Calculate the Required Belt Width (b)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the necessary belt width by dividing the design power by the allowable power per inch.\n$$ b = \\frac{P_d}{H_a} $$\n$$ b = \\frac{84 \\text{ hp}}{11.05 \\text{ hp/in}} \\approx 7.6 \\text{ in} $$\n\n### 6. Final Belt Selection\n\nBelts are sold in standard widths. We must round up to the next available standard size to ensure the belt is strong enough. The next standard width after 7.6 inches is **8 inches**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nSelect an **8-inch wide Polyamide A-3 flat belt**."

                                    "solution": "Here is a step-by-step solution to the V-belt design problem.\n\n### 1. Determine the Design Power\n\nFirst, we need to figure out the power the belt must actually handle. We start with the actual power transmitted and then apply a service factor to account for the harsh conditions of a single-cylinder engine.\n\n*   **Actual Power (P_a):** The problem states that 60% of the 5-hp engine power is transmitted.\n    $$P_a = 5.0 \\text{ hp} \\times 0.60 = 3.0 \\text{ hp}$$\n\n*   **Service Factor (K_s):** A single-cylinder engine provides jerky power, which is tough on a belt. We use a service factor to account for this. For a single-cylinder engine driving a transmission, a typical service factor is `K_s = 1.4`.\n\n*   **Design Power (P_d):** This is the power we'll use for our design calculations.\n    $$P_d = P_a \\times K_s = 3.0 \\text{ hp} \\times 1.4 = 4.2 \\text{ hp}$$\n\n### 2. Select a V-Belt Section\n\nWe choose the belt size (its cross-section) based on the design power (4.2 hp) and the speed of the smaller, driving sheave (3100 rev/min).\n\nUsing a standard V-belt selection chart, a **Classical A-Section** belt is a suitable choice for this power and speed range.\n\n### 3. Determine the Drive Geometry\n\nNow we establish the physical layout of the sheaves and belt.\n\n*   **Belt Length (L_p):** The goal is a pitch length near 92 inches. The closest standard size for an A-section belt is an **A90**, which has a standard pitch length of:\n    $$L_p = 91.8 \\text{ in}$$\n\n*   **Center Distance (C):** With the sheave diameters and belt length known, we can calculate the required center-to-center distance between the sheaves.\n    $$C \\approx 31.5 \\text{ in}$$\n\n*   **Angle of Wrap (\u03b8_d):** The angle of contact on the smaller sheave is important for grip. A smaller angle means less grip.\n    $$\\theta_d = 180^\\circ - 2 \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{D-d}{2C}\\right)$$\n    $$\\theta_d = 180^\\circ - 2 \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{12.0 - 6.2}{2 \\times 31.5}\\right) = 169.4^\\circ$$\n    This is a good wrap angle (well above 120\u00b0).\n\n### 4. Calculate the Allowable Power\n\nNext, we find the amount of power one A90 belt can handle in this specific setup. This is found by taking a base power rating and applying correction factors.\n\n*   **Belt Speed (V):**\n    $$V = \\frac{\\pi d n_1}{12} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 6.2 \\text{ in} \\times 3100 \\text{ rev/min}}{12 \\text{ in/ft}} = 5035 \\text{ ft/min}$$\n\n*   **Rated Power (P_r):** From standard manufacturer tables for an A-section belt at 3100 rev/min on a 6.2-inch sheave, the rated power is approximately:\n    $$P_r \\approx 6.1 \\text{ hp}$$\n\n*   **Correction Factors:**\n    *   **Angle Correction (K_\u03b8):** For our wrap angle of 169.4\u00b0, the factor is `K_\u03b8 \u2248 0.98`.\n    *   **Length Correction (K_L):** For an A90 belt, the factor is `K_L \u2248 1.03`.\n\n*   **Allowable Power (P_allowable):** This is the final, corrected power rating for our single belt.\n    $$P_{allowable} = P_r \\times K_\\theta \\times K_L$$\n    $$P_{allowable} = 6.1 \\text{ hp} \\times 0.98 \\times 1.03 = 6.16 \\text{ hp}$$\n\n### 5. Assess Factor of Safety (N_fs)\n\nThe factor of safety tells us how much stronger the belt is than it needs to be. Since we only need to transmit a design power of 4.2 hp, and our selected belt can handle 6.16 hp, a single belt is sufficient.\n\n$$N_{fs} = \\frac{\\text{Allowable Power}}{\\text{Design Power}} = \\frac{P_{allowable}}{P_d}$$\n$$N_{fs} = \\frac{6.16 \\text{ hp}}{4.2 \\text{ hp}} = 1.47$$\n\nA factor of safety of 1.47 is excellent for this application, indicating a robust and safe design.\n\n### 6. Assess Belt Life in Passes\n\nA \"pass\" is one full revolution of the belt. Belt life is related to how many times it can flex around the sheaves before failing.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Life:** With a high factor of safety (1.47), the belt is not under high stress. This means it is not expected to fail from fatigue. Instead, its life will be determined by wear and aging of the rubber.\n*   **Estimated Life:** For a well-designed V-belt drive like this one, a very long life can be expected. A reasonable engineering estimate for the life of this belt would be in the range of **10\u2077 to 10\u2078 passes** (10 million to 100 million passes).\n\n***\n\n### Final Selection Summary\n\n*   **Belt:** A-Section, **A90** (91.8-inch pitch length)\n*   **Center Distance:** Approx. **31.5 inches**\n*   **Factor of Safety:** **1.47** (Excellent)\n*   **Expected Life:** **Very Long** (estimated 10\u2077 - 10\u2078 passes), limited by wear, not fatigue."

We can find it by analyzing the lever system. We sum the moments about the pivot point to be zero.\n\nThe lever gives us a mechanical advantage. The actuating force `F` is applied at a distance of `a + b` from the pivot, and the normal force `N` acts at a distance `a`.\n\n$$\n\\sum M_{\\text{pivot}} = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n(F \\times (a+b)) - (N \\times a) = 0\n$$\n\nSolving for the normal force `N`:\n\n$$\nN = \\frac{F \\times (a+b)}{a}\n$$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n$$\nN = \\frac{90 \\, \\text{lb} \\times (8 \\, \\text{in} + 12 \\, \\text{in})}{8 \\, \\text{in}} = \\frac{90 \\times 20}{8} = 225 \\, \\text{lb}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the Maximum Pressure (P_max)\n\nBecause the contact angle (`90\u00b0`) is large, this is considered a \"long-shoe\" brake. In long-shoe brakes, the pressure is not uniform across the shoe face. It is highest at the center and lowest at the edges.\n\nThe relationship between the total normal force `N` and the maximum pressure `P_max` for a symmetric long-shoe brake is given by:\n\n$$\nN = P_{\\text{max}} \\cdot r \\cdot w \\left( \\theta + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\theta) \\right)\n$$\n\nWhere:\n*   `\u03b8` is half the contact angle, in **radians**.\n*   `2\u03b8 = 90\u00b0`, so `\u03b8 = 45\u00b0`.\n*   To convert to radians: `\u03b8 = 45\u00b0 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180\u00b0} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}` radians.\n\nNow, we rearrange the formula to solve for `P_max`:\n\n$$\nP_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{N}{r \\cdot w \\left( \\theta + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\theta) \\right)}\n$$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   `N = 225` lb\n*   `r = 6` in\n*   `w = 1.25` in\n*   `\u03b8 = \\pi/4` rad\n*   `2\u03b8 = \\pi/2` rad (or `90\u00b0`)\n\n$$\nP_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{225}{6 \\times 1.25 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(90^\\circ) \\right)}\n$$\n\n$$\nP_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{225}{7.5 \\left( 0.7854 + \\frac{1}{2}(1) \\right)} = \\frac{225}{7.5(1.2854)}\n$$\n\n$$\nP_{\\text{max}} \\approx 23.34 \\, \\text{psi}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find the Braking Torque (T)\n\nThe braking torque is generated by the frictional force acting at the radius of the drum. For a long-shoe brake, we find the torque using the following formula, which accounts for the varying pressure:\n\n$$\nT = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\mu \\cdot N \\cdot r \\cdot \\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\theta)}\n$$\n\nPlugging in the values we already know:\n*   `\u03bc = 0.25`\n*   `N = 225` lb\n*   `r = 6` in\n*   The denominator term `(\\theta + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\theta))` we already calculated as `1.2854`.\n\n$$\nT = \\frac{2 \\times 0.25 \\times 225 \\times 6 \\times \\sin(45^\\circ)}{1.2854}\n$$\n\n$$\nT = \\frac{675 \\times 0.7071}{1.2854} = \\frac{477.3}{1.2854}\n$$\n\n$$\nT \\approx 371.3 \\, \\text{lb-in}\n$$\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   **Maximum pressure on the shoe (P_max):** **23.34 psi**\n*   **Braking Torque (T):** **371.3 lb-in**"

Summarize Properties and Loads**\n\nFirst, let's list the information we have.\n\n*   **Geometric Ratios:**\n    *   $d = 0.75D \\implies D/d = 1/0.75 \\approx 1.33$\n    *   $r = D/20 \\implies r/d = (D/d)/20 = 1.33/20 \\approx 0.067$\n*   **Material Properties (SAE 2340 Steel):**\n    *   Ultimate Tensile Strength, $S_{ut} = 1226$ MPa\n    *   Yield Strength, $S_y = 1130$ MPa\n*   **Loading:**\n    *   Alternating Bending Moment, $M_a = 70$ N.m\n    *   Mean Bending Moment, $M_m = 0$ N.m\n    *   Mean Torsional Moment, $T_m = 45$ N.m\n    *   Alternating Torsional Moment, $T_a = 0$ N.m\n*   **Design Factor:**\n    *   $n_d = 2.5$\n\n### **2. Determine the Endurance Limit ($S_e$)**\n\nThe endurance limit is the stress a material can withstand for an infinite number of cycles. We start with an estimate and then correct it using Marin factors.\n\n**A. Estimated Endurance Limit ($S_e'$)**\nFor steels, the estimate is half the ultimate strength.\n$$\nS_e' = 0.5 \\times S_{ut} = 0.5 \\times 1226 \\text{ MPa} = 613 \\text{ MPa}\n$$\n\n**B. Corrected Endurance Limit ($S_e$)**\nWe apply correction factors to get a more accurate value.\n$$\nS_e = k_a k_b k_c k_d k_e S_e'\n$$\n*   **$k_a$ (Surface Finish Factor):** For a ground surface finish, a typical value is $k_a \\approx 0.88$.\n*   **$k_b$ (Size Factor):** This depends on the diameter `d`, which we don't know yet. We will need to guess and check.\n*   **$k_c$ (Load Factor):** For bending, $k_c = 1$.\n*   **$k_d$ (Temperature Factor):** Assuming room temperature, $k_d = 1$.\n*   **$k_e$ (Reliability Factor):** For a standard 99% reliability, $k_e = 0.814$.\n\nSince $k_b$ depends on `d`, the entire process will be iterative.\n\n### **3. Determine Stress Concentration Factors**\n\nThe shoulder on the shaft creates stress concentrations.\n\n*   **Geometric Factors ($K_t, K_{ts}$):** From standard stress concentration charts for a stepped shaft with our ratios ($D/d \\approx 1.33$, $r/d \\approx 0.067$):\n    *   Bending: $K_t \\approx 1.9$\n    *   Torsion: $K_{ts} \\approx 1.5$\n*   **Fatigue Factors ($K_f, K_{fs}$):** These account for how sensitive the material is to notches. They also depend on `d` (through the radius `r`).\n    *   $K_f = 1 + q(K_t - 1)$\n    *   $K_{fs} = 1 + q(K_{ts} - 1)$\n    *   The notch sensitivity, `q`, will be determined during our iterative calculation.\n\n### **4. Iterative Calculation for Diameter (d)**\n\nWe will use the **DE-Goodman fatigue criterion**, which is a safe and common method for designing against fatigue. The design equation for diameter `d` is:\n$$\nd = \\left[ \\frac{16 n_d}{\\pi} \\left( \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{K_f M_a}{S_e} \\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4} \\left( \\frac{K_{fs} T_m}{S_{ut}} \\right)^2 } \\right) \\right]^{1/3}\n$$\nHowever, a more direct form of the DE-Goodman equation is often easier for this specific loading case (alternating bending, mean torsion):\n$$\nd = \\left[ \\frac{n_d}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{32 K_f M_a}{S_e} + \\frac{16 \\sqrt{3} K_{fs} T_m}{S_{ut}} \\right) \\right]^{1/3}\n$$\nWe'll use this second, simpler equation. Let's start iterating.\n\n**Iteration 1**\n\n1.  **Guess a diameter:** Let's start with $d = 30$ mm.\n2.  **Find `d`-dependent factors:**\n    *   **Size Factor ($k_b$):** For $d=30$ mm, $k_b = 1.24(30)^{-0.107} \\approx 0.87$.\n    *   **Notch Sensitivity (`q`):** The notch radius is $r = d/15 = 30/15 = 2$ mm. For this radius and material, $q \\approx 0.92$.\n    *   **Fatigue Factors ($K_f, K_{fs}$):**\n        *   $K_f = 1 + 0.92(1.9 - 1) = 1.83$\n        *   $K_{fs} = 1 + 0.92(1.5 - 1) = 1.46$\n3.  **Calculate $S_e$:**\n    *   $S_e = (0.88)(0.87)(1)(1)(0.814)(613) = 381.5$ MPa\n4.  **Calculate new `d`:**\n    *   Convert moments to N\u00b7mm: $M_a = 70,000$ N\u00b7mm, $T_m = 45,000$ N\u00b7mm.\n    $$\n    d^3 = \\frac{2.5}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{32 (1.83) (70000)}{381.5} + \\frac{16 \\sqrt{3} (1.46) (45000)}{1226} \\right]\n    $$\n    $$\n    d^3 = 0.796 [10745 + 1485] = 9734\n    $$\n    $$\n    d = (9734)^{1/3} \\approx 21.35 \\text{ mm}\n    $$\nOur guess (30 mm) was too high. Let's try again with a value closer to our result.\n\n**Iteration 2**\n\n1.  **New guess:** Let's use $d = 22$ mm.\n2.  **Find `d`-dependent factors:**\n    *   **Size Factor ($k_b$):** For $d=22$ mm, $k_b = 1.24(22)^{-0.107} \\approx 0.89$.\n    *   **Notch Sensitivity (`q`):** The radius is $r = d/15 = 22/15 = 1.47$ mm. For this radius, $q \\approx 0.90$.\n    *   **Fatigue Factors ($K_f, K_{fs}$):**\n        *   $K_f = 1 + 0.90(1.9 - 1) = 1.81$\n        *   $K_{fs} = 1 + 0.90(1.5 - 1) = 1.45$\n3.  **Calculate $S_e$:**\n    *   $S_e = (0.88)(0.89)(1)(1)(0.814)(613) = 391.2$ MPa\n4.  **Calculate new `d`:**\n    $$\n    d^3 = \\frac{2.5}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{32 (1.81) (70000)}{391.2} + \\frac{16 \\sqrt{3} (1.45) (45000)}{1226} \\right]\n    $$\n    $$\n    d^3 = 0.796 [10364 + 1475] = 9422\n    $$\n    $$\n    d = (9422)^{1/3} \\approx 21.12 \\text{ mm}\n    $$\nThis result (21.12 mm) is very close to our guess (22 mm). The calculation has converged.\n\n### **5. Select Standard Size and Final Design**\n\nThe calculated required diameter is **21.12 mm**. We must choose a standard metric rolling-bearing bore size that is equal to or larger than this value. Common sizes are 20 mm, 22 mm, and 25 mm.\n\nTo be safe, we select the next size up.\n**Selected diameter, d = 22 mm**\n\nNow we can define the final dimensions of the shaft section:\n*   $d = 22$ mm\n*   $D = d / 0.75 = 22 / 0.75 \\approx 29.3$ mm\n*   $r = D / 20 = 29.3 / 20 \\approx 1.47$ mm\n\nFinally, let's quickly check for yielding with our final design to ensure it won't fail on the first cycle. The factor of safety against yielding is found to be over 8, which is much greater than our design factor of 2.5, so the design is safe."

Allowable Horsepower\n\nFirst, we find the basic horsepower rating for a single-strand No. 60 chain and then adjust it for a double-strand chain.\n\n**Step 1: Find Chain Pitch (P)**\nFor a No. 60 chain, the pitch is given by the first digit multiplied by 1/8 inch.\n`P = 6/8 = 0.75 inches`\n\n**Step 2: Find Rated Horsepower (HP_rated)**\nUsing standard roller chain power rating tables (like those in Shigley's or other design handbooks), we look up the power for a No. 60 chain with a 13-tooth sprocket running at 300 rev/min.\n*   From the tables, the rated power is approximately **HP_rated = 4.78 hp**.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Strand Factor (K\u2082)**\nThe tables are for a single-strand chain. Since we have a double-strand chain, we multiply by a strand factor.\n*   For a double-strand chain, the factor **K\u2082 = 1.7**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Allowable Horsepower (HP_allowable)**\nThe allowable (or corrected) horsepower is the rated power multiplied by the strand factor.\n\n$$\n\\text{HP}_{\\text{allowable}} = \\text{HP}_{\\text{rated}} \\times K_2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{HP}_{\\text{allowable}} = 4.78 \\times 1.7 = 8.13 \\text{ hp}\n$$\n\n### 2. Center-to-Center Distance\n\nWe can estimate the center distance (C) using the chain length (L) and the number of teeth on the sprockets (N\u2081 and N\u2082).\n\n**Step 1: Use the Approximate Formula for Center Distance**\nThe formula relating these variables is:\n\n$$\nC \\approx \\frac{P}{8} \\left[ 2L - (N_1 + N_2) + \\sqrt{(2L - (N_1 + N_2))^2 - \\frac{8(N_2 - N_1)^2}{\\pi^2}} \\right]\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Plug in the Values**\n*   P = 0.75 in\n*   L = 82 pitches\n*   N\u2081 = 13 teeth\n*   N\u2082 = 52 teeth\n\n$$\nC \\approx \\frac{0.75}{8} \\left[ 2(82) - (13 + 52) + \\sqrt{(2(82) - (13 + 52))^2 - \\frac{8(52 - 13)^2}{\\pi^2}} \\right]\n$$\n\n$$\nC \\approx 0.09375 \\left[ 164 - 65 + \\sqrt{(99)^2 - \\frac{8(39)^2}{9.87}} \\right]\n$$\n\n$$\nC \\approx 0.09375 \\left[ 99 + \\sqrt{9801 - 1231.3} \\right]\n$$\n\n$$\nC \\approx 0.09375 \\left[ 99 + 92.57 \\right] \\approx 17.96 \\text{ inches}\n$$\n\nThe estimated center-to-center distance is **17.96 inches**. This is approximately `17.96 / 0.75 = 23.95`, or about **24 pitches**.\n\n### 3. Torque and Bending Force\n\nFinally, we'll calculate the torque and bending force on the driving shaft based on the actual power being transmitted.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Actual Transmitted Horsepower (HP_actual)**\nThe problem states the actual power is 30% less than the allowable power.\n\n$$\n\\text{HP}_{\\text{actual}} = \\text{HP}_{\\text{allowable}} \\times (1 - 0.30)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{HP}_{\\text{actual}} = 8.13 \\times 0.70 = 5.69 \\text{ hp}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Torque on Driving Shaft (T\u2081)**\nThe relationship between horsepower, torque, and speed is:\n\n$$\n\\text{HP} = \\frac{T \\times n}{63025}\n$$\n\nRearranging for Torque (T), where T is in lb-in:\n\n$$\nT_1 = \\frac{\\text{HP}_{\\text{actual}} \\times 63025}{n_1}\n$$\n\n$$\nT_1 = \\frac{5.69 \\times 63025}{300} = 1195.5 \\text{ lb-in}\n$$\n\nThe torque on the driving shaft is **1195.5 lb-in**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Bending Force on Driving Shaft (F_b)**\nThe bending force is the pull of the chain on the sprocket. We can find this from the torque and the sprocket's pitch radius (r\u2081).\n\nFirst, find the pitch radius (r\u2081) of the driving sprocket:\n$$\nr_1 = \\frac{P}{2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{180^\\circ}{N_1}\\right)} = \\frac{0.75}{2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{180^\\circ}{13}\\right)} = \\frac{0.75}{2 \\times 0.2396} = 1.57 \\text{ inches}\n$$\n\nNow, calculate the chain pull, which is the bending force (F_b):\n$$\nT_1 = F_b \\times r_1 \\implies F_b = \\frac{T_1}{r_1}\n$$\n\n$$\nF_b = \\frac{1195.5 \\text{ lb-in}}{1.57 \\text{ in}} = 761.5 \\text{ lb}\n$$\n\nThe bending force on the driving shaft is **761.5 lb**."

We already calculated this in our final iteration.\n\n$$\nH = 1425 \\text{ lbf\u00b7in/s}\n$$\n\nIt's helpful to express this in more common units like horsepower (hp) or Btu/min.\n\n*   **In horsepower:**\n    $$\n    H = \\frac{1425 \\text{ lbf\u00b7in/s}}{6600 \\text{ lbf\u00b7in/s per hp}} = 0.216 \\text{ hp}\n    $$\n*   **In Btu per minute:**\n    $$\n    H = (0.153 \\text{ Btu/s}) \\times (60 \\text{ s/min}) = 9.18 \\text{ Btu/min}\n    $$\n\n**Answer:** The heat loss rate is **0.216 hp** (or 9.18 Btu/min)."

Geometric Properties and Velocity\n\nFirst, we find the basic dimensions of the pinion and its speed.\n\n*   **Pinion Pitch Diameter ($d_p$)**: The diameter is the module times the number of teeth.\n    $$ d_p = m \\times N_p = 4 \\text{ mm} \\times 22 = 88 \\text{ mm} $$\n*   **Pitch Line Velocity ($V$)**: This is the linear speed at the pitch diameter.\n    $$ V = \\frac{\\pi d_p n_p}{60} = \\frac{\\pi \\times (0.088 \\text{ m}) \\times (1800 \\text{ rev/min})}{60 \\text{ s/min}} = 8.29 \\text{ m/s} $$\n\n### 2. Allowable Contact Stress ($S_{ac}$)\n\nNext, we calculate the maximum stress the gear tooth surface can withstand for the required life and reliability.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$ S_{ac} = \\frac{S_c' C_L C_H}{C_T C_R} $$\n\n*   **$S_c'$ (Material Strength)**: For through-hardened steel with 180 HB, the allowable contact stress number is approximately:\n    $S_c' = 2.22(\\text{HB}) + 200 = 2.22(180) + 200 \\approx 600 \\text{ MPa}$\n*   **$C_L$ (Life Factor)**: For a very long life of $10^9$ revolutions, this factor reduces the allowable stress. From AGMA charts, a typical value is $C_L \\approx 0.85$.\n*   **$C_H$ (Hardness Ratio Factor)**: Since the pinion and gear have the same hardness, $C_H = 1.0$.\n*   **$C_T$ (Temperature Factor)**: Assuming normal operating temperatures, $C_T = 1.0$.\n*   **$C_R$ (Reliability Factor)**: For a high reliability of 0.999, the gear must be derated. From AGMA tables, $C_R = 1.25$.\n\nNow, we calculate $S_{ac}$:\n$$ S_{ac} = \\frac{600 \\text{ MPa} \\times 0.85 \\times 1.0}{1.0 \\times 1.25} = 408 \\text{ MPa} $$\n\n### 3. Allowable Tangential Load ($W_t$)\n\nThis is the maximum tangential force the gear can transmit without pitting, calculated using the AGMA formula.\n\n$$ W_t = d_p b I \\left( \\frac{S_{ac}}{C_p} \\right)^2 \\frac{C_v}{C_o C_m} $$\n\n*   **$d_p = 88$ mm** and **$b = 25$ mm** (from the problem).\n*   **$I$ (Geometry Factor)**: This factor depends on the tooth shape and gear ratio. From AGMA charts for a 22/24 tooth straight bevel gear, a typical value is $I \\approx 0.082$.\n*   **$C_p$ (Elastic Coefficient)**: For steel gears, $C_p = 191 \\sqrt{\\text{MPa}}$.\n*   **$C_v$ (Dynamic Factor)**: This accounts for inaccuracies at high speed. For accuracy number 5 and a velocity of 8.29 m/s, a simplified approximation gives $C_v \\approx 0.55$.\n*   **$C_o$ (Overload Factor)**: Since the application is not specified, we assume a standard value for moderate shock from the motor or load, $C_o = 1.25$.\n*   **$C_m$ (Mounting Factor)**: Outboard mounting is less rigid and increases stress concentration. A typical value for this mounting is $C_m = 1.6$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the allowable load $W_t$:\n$$ W_t = (88)(25)(0.082) \\left( \\frac{408}{191} \\right)^2 \\frac{0.55}{1.25 \\times 1.6} $$\n$$ W_t = (180.4) (2.136)^2 \\left( \\frac{0.55}{2.0} \\right) $$\n$$ W_t = (180.4) (4.56) (0.275) \\approx 226.5 \\text{ N} $$\n\n### 4. Power Rating ($P$)\n\nFinally, we find the power rating using the tangential load and velocity.\n\n*   **Formula**: Power = Force \u00d7 Velocity\n    $$ P = W_t \\times V $$\n*   **Calculation**:\n    $$ P = 226.5 \\text{ N} \\times 8.29 \\text{ m/s} = 1878 \\text{ Watts} $$\n\nConverting to kilowatts (kW):\n$$ P = 1.88 \\text{ kW} $$"

                                    "solution": "Here is a step-by-step solution to select the right bearings for the squeeze roll.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Forces on the Shaft\n\nFirst, we need to find all the forces acting on the shaft from the roll and the gear.\n\n**1. Forces from the Squeeze Roll:**\nThe problem gives forces per inch of roll length. The total distance between the bearings is `3 in + 5 in = 8 in`, so we'll assume the roll length is 8 inches.\n\n*   **Total Normal Force (acts vertically, in the z-direction):**\n    `F_N = 35 lbf/in * 8 in = 280 lbf`\n*   **Total Pull Force (acts horizontally, in the y-direction):**\n    `F_P = 28 lbf/in * 8 in = 224 lbf`\n\nThese forces are distributed along the roll. We can simplify this by treating them as single forces acting at the center of the roll (x = 4 in from O).\n\n**2. Forces from the Gear:**\nThe pull force on the material creates a torque that the gear must provide.\n\n*   **Torque (T):**\n    ```latex\n    T = F_P \\times (\\text{roll radius}) = 224 \\text{ lbf} \\times \\frac{4 \\text{ in}}{2} = 448 \\text{ lbf-in}\n    ```\n*   **Tangential Gear Force (F_gt):** This force transmits the torque.\n    ```latex\n    F_{gt} = \\frac{T}{\\text{gear radius}} = \\frac{448 \\text{ lbf-in}}{3 \\text{ in} / 2} = 298.7 \\text{ lbf}\n    ```\n*   **Radial Gear Force (F_gr):** This force pushes the gears apart. We'll assume a standard 20\u00b0 pressure angle.\n    ```latex\n    F_{gr} = F_{gt} \\tan(20^\\circ) = 298.7 \\tan(20^\\circ) = 108.7 \\text{ lbf}\n    ```\n\nWe will assume `F_gt` acts in the horizontal (y) direction and `F_gr` acts in the vertical (z) direction. The gear is located at x = 3 in from O.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Bearing Reaction Forces\n\nNow, we'll find the support forces at bearings O and A. We'll do this by looking at the horizontal (XY plane) and vertical (YZ plane) forces separately.\n\n**Vertical Forces (YZ Plane):**\n*   Forces: `F_N = 280 lbf` (down) at x=4 in, and `F_gr = 108.7 lbf` (down) at x=3 in.\n*   Sum of moments about O:\n    `R_{Az} \\times 8 - (280 \\times 4) - (108.7 \\times 3) = 0 \\implies R_{Az} = 180.8 \\text{ lbf}`\n*   Sum of forces:\n    `R_{Oz} + 180.8 - 280 - 108.7 = 0 \\implies R_{Oz} = 207.9 \\text{ lbf}`\n\n**Horizontal Forces (XY Plane):**\n*   Forces: `F_P = 224 lbf` at x=4 in, and `F_gt = 298.7 lbf` (opposite direction) at x=3 in.\n*   Sum of moments about O:\n    `R_{Ay} \\times 8 + (224 \\times 4) - (298.7 \\times 3) = 0 \\implies R_{Ay} \\approx 0 \\text{ lbf}`\n*   Sum of forces:\n    `R_{Oy} + 0 + 224 - 298.7 = 0 \\implies R_{Oy} = 74.7 \\text{ lbf}`\n\n**Total Radial Load on Each Bearing:**\n*   **Bearing O:** `F_{rO} = \\sqrt{R_{Oy}^2 + R_{Oz}^2} = \\sqrt{74.7^2 + 207.9^2} = 221 \\text{ lbf}`\n*   **Bearing A:** `F_{rA} = \\sqrt{R_{Ay}^2 + R_{Az}^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + 180.8^2} = 181 \\text{ lbf}`\n\nBearing O has the higher radial load.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Equivalent Dynamic Load (P)\n\nAngular-contact bearings can handle both radial and axial (thrust) loads. A radial load creates an *induced thrust*. We must account for this to find the total load.\n\n*   Assuming a standard mounting, the bearing with the larger radial load (Bearing O) will determine the axial load for the pair.\n*   For 02-series angular-contact bearings, we use typical factors: `X = 0.41` and `Y = 1.4`.\n*   The induced thrust at O is `F_{iO} = 0.5 \\times F_{rO} / Y = 0.5 \\times 221 / 1.4 = 79` lbf.\n*   This induced thrust becomes the axial load for both bearings: `F_{aO} = F_{aA} = 79` lbf.\n\nNow we calculate the **equivalent dynamic load (P)**, which combines radial and axial loads into a single value for life calculations.\n\n*   **For Bearing O:**\n    ```latex\n    P_O = X \\cdot F_{rO} + Y \\cdot F_{aO} = 0.41(221) + 1.4(79) = 201 \\text{ lbf}\n    ```\n*   **For Bearing A:**\n    ```latex\n    P_A = X \\cdot F_{rA} + Y \\cdot F_{aA} = 0.41(181) + 1.4(79) = 185 \\text{ lbf}\n    ```\nThe higher load is on bearing O, so we use `P = 201` lbf for our selection.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required Load Rating (C\u2081\u2080)\n\nThe `C\u2081\u2080` rating is the load a bearing can handle for 1 million revolutions with 90% reliability. We need to find the `C\u2081\u2080` required for our specific life and reliability goals.\n\n**1. Required Life in Revolutions (L\u2081\u2080):**\n*   **Design Life (L_D):**\n    `L_D = 35,000 \\text{ hr} \\times 350 \\text{ rev/min} \\times 60 \\text{ min/hr} = 7.35 \\times 10^8 \\text{ revolutions}`\n*   **Reliability Adjustment:**\n    The combined reliability for two bearings is 0.92, so for a single bearing, it's `R = \\sqrt{0.92} = 0.959`. Since this is higher than the standard 90%, we need a tougher bearing. We adjust the required life to find the equivalent L\u2081\u2080 life. A simple life adjustment factor for this reliability is `a_R \u2248 0.54`.\n    `L_{10, \\text{req}} = L_D / a_R = 7.35 \\times 10^8 / 0.54 = 1.36 \\times 10^9 \\text{ revolutions}`\n\n**2. Required C\u2081\u2080 Rating:**\nNow we use the bearing life equation. For ball bearings, the exponent `k` is 3.\n\n```latex\nC_{10, \\text{req}} = a_f \\cdot P \\cdot \\left( \\frac{L_{10, \\text{req}}}{10^6} \\right)^{1/k}\n```\n*   `a_f` = 1.2 (Application Factor)\n*   `P` = 201 lbf (Equivalent Load)\n*   `L_{10, \\text{req}}` = 1.36 x 10\u2079 revolutions\n*   `k` = 3 (for ball bearings)\n\n```latex\nC_{10, \\text{req}} = 1.2 \\cdot 201 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1.36 \\times 10^9}{10^6} \\right)^{1/3}\n```\n```latex\nC_{10, \\text{req}} = 241.2 \\cdot (1360)^{1/3} = 241.2 \\cdot (11.08) = 2673 \\text{ lbf}\n```\nSo, we need a bearing with a dynamic load rating of at least **2673 lbf** (or 11.9 kN).\n\n### Step 5: Select a Suitable Bearing\n\nWe now look in a bearing catalog for a **02-series angular-contact ball bearing** with a `C\u2081\u2080` rating greater than 2673 lbf.\n\nA good choice would be a **7204** series bearing.\n\n*   **Bearing Number:** 7204\n*   **Bore Diameter:** 20 mm\n*   **Outside Diameter:** 47 mm\n*   **`C\u2081\u2080` Rating:** 12.7 kN (approx. **2855 lbf**)\n\nSince `2855 lbf > 2673 lbf`, this bearing is suitable for the application. We would select two identical **7204** angular-contact bearings for locations O and A."
